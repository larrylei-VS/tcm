#### Commentary

Shènshū BL-23 is the back-shu point of the Kidney zang where the qi of the Kidneys emanates from the interior to the body surface, and like all the back-shu points (especially those of the zang) has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level. Shènshū BL-23 is one of the principal acupuncture points to strengthen the Kidneys, fortify yang, nourish yin, and benefit essence.

According to the Spiritual Pivot[37](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references) "The Kidneys store the essence" and "essence is the source of life". The Essential Questions[38](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references) states "Essence is the root of the human body", whilst a saying of Chinese medicine emphasises "The Kidney is the root of pre-heaven". Since neither essence nor pre-heaven qi can ever be excessive, the Kidneys can only suffer from deficiency patterns. Kidney deficiency may be congenital in origin, or may develop during the course of a person's life as a result of chronic illness, dissipation, excessive sexual activity, overwork, old age, prolonged fear, or prolonged disharmony of other zangfu which eventually transmits to the Kidneys. Deficiency of the Kidneys is subdivided into the following patterns: i. Kidney qi not firm, ii. Failure of the Kidneys to grasp the qi, iii. deficiency of Kidney essence, iv. deficiency of Kidney yang, v. deficiency of Kidney yin. Shènshū BL-23 is an essential point in the treatment of all these patterns.

The Kidneys dominate the two lower yin (urethra and anus) and control the opening and closing of the Bladder and its qi transformation function. Deficiency of the Kidney qi (Kidney qi not firm) therefore, may impair the Kidneys' ability to firmly hold and astringe the urine resulting in such symptoms of leakage as frequent urination, dripping urination, enuresis, white turbidity due to deficiency and exhaustion etc.

According to the Master Hua's Classic of the Central Viscera by the great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo, the Kidneys "serve the purpose of shutting in the essence in males"[39](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references). Deficiency of Kidney qi, therefore, may give rise to leakage of essence manifesting as seminal emission, seminal emission with dreams, urine containing semen and premature ejaculation. This kind of leakage may be seen in the context of qi deficiency alone (in other words without accompanying symptoms of cold or heat), or as part of deficiency of either Kidney yang or Kidney yin, more commonly the former since qi belongs to the broad category of yang. Whatever the pattern, Shènshū BL-23 is an important point to firm the holding and astringing action of the Kidneys.

The Kidneys control the movement of water throughout the body, and although the Spleen and Lung also play an important role in the circulation of fluids, their yang qi is ultimately dependent on that of the Kidneys. This is reflected in the statement that the Kidneys dominate the yang of the whole body and govern water'. When Kidney yang fails to move the body fluids there may be oedema with difficult urination. The Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas says "Shènshū BL-23 treats the hundred oedematous diseases" (i.e. any kind of oedema).

The uterus depends on the Kidney essence for its growth, maturation and nourishment, the Penetrating and Conception vessels are both nourished by and have their root in the Kidneys, and the Essential Questions says "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys"[40](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references). Shènshū BL-23 is indicated for a variety of disorders of the uterus including irregular menstruation due to Kidney deficiency, chronic cold of the uterus giving rise to taxation, 'emaciation in women due to sexual intercourse during menstruation' and leucorrhoea.

The intimate relationship between the Kidney yang and ming men (the gate of life) has been emphasised in numerous classics. According to the Classic of Difficulties[41](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references) "On the left is the Kidney, on the right is ming men", whilst Li Dong-yuan wrote "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is ming men". Zhang Jing-yue of the Ming dynasty stated "ming men resides between the Kidneys" and "ming men is the root of original qi and the residence of the water and fire; without it the yin qi of the five zang is unable to grow, the yang qi of the five zang is unable to develop". The Kidney yang therefore corresponds to ming men fire and is the source of the fire of the whole body. Failure of Kidney yang to warm the body leads to such symptoms as chronic cold of the uterus, lumbar region, legs and bones. Decline of the Kidney yang and waning of ming men fire may lead to weakness of the sexual function and hence impotence. Kidney yang is also the source of Spleen yang. When Kidney yang is unable to warm Spleen and Stomach earth there may be chronic diarrhoea due to cold or dampness, diarrhoea containing undigested food, cold and distention of the Stomach, and cold vomiting. The diarrhoea associated with this pattern characteristically occurs in the early hours of the morning and is known as fifth-watch (cockcrow) diarrhoea. The Complete Works of Jing-yue stated "The opening and closing of the two excretions is dominated by the Kidneys. When the yang qi of the Kidneys is insufficient, then ming men is in decline and yin cold is in abundance; therefore after the fifth watch when the yang qi of the Kidneys is in decline and the yin qi is reaching its zenith there will be ceaseless diarrhoea".

According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "The Lung is the master of qi, the Kidneys are the root of qi. The Lung dominates the exhalation of qi whilst the Kidneys dominate the reception of qi. Only when yin and yang are mutually communicating is respiration harmonious". This quotation emphasises the essential role of the Kidneys in normal respiration. The Lung is the uppermost zang with the function of descending the qi and controlling exhalation, whilst the Kidneys are the bottomost zang with the function of grasping the qi and controlling inhalation. If Kidney qi is deficient and unable to grasp and hold the Lung qi there may be dyspnoea, asthma or cough. This pattern is characterised by its chronic nature and is usually seen with other accompanying signs of Kidney deficiency. As is the case with Kidney qi not firm, this pattern may be seen either without symptoms of cold or heat, or in the context of deficiency of either Kidney yang or Kidney yin.

According to Essential Readings from the Medical Tradition "The fire and water of the human body is yin and yang ... without yang, yin cannot engender; without yin, yang cannot transform" whilst in the Complete Works of Jing-yue it is said "yin and yang are of the same origin...fire is the ruler of water, water is the source of fire...". These quotations underline the inseparable relationship of the yin and yang of the Kidneys and help explain why all acupuncture points which treat the Kidneys invariably benefit both Kidney yin and Kidney yang. Although the indications for Shènshū BL-23 emphasise deficiency of Kidney qi or Kidney yang, therefore, it also has an action on nourishing Kidney yin.

Like Kidney yang, Kidney yin is the root of the yin of the whole body. Kidney yin deficiency may lead to impaired nourishment of the body and the flaring up of deficiency fire, giving rise to such symptoms as emaciation, wasting and thirsting disorder, and redness and heat of the face and body.

It is a characteristic of the yin back-shu points that they nourish and regulate their corresponding sense organs. According to the Spiritual Pivot[42](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references) "The Kidneys open into the ears; if the Kidneys are in harmony, the ears can hear the five sounds". Since the Kidneys store essence, produce marrow which fills up the brain and dominate yin, Shènshū BL-23 is indicated not only for ear disorders such as tinnitus and deafness, but also for blurred vision, night blindness and visual dizziness, all due to deficiency of marrow, essence or yin.

Since the Kidney yin and yang are the root of the yin fluids and the yang qi of the body, this explains the action of Shènshū BL-23 in diseases of chronic deficiency. It is indicated for the five taxations and the seven injuries, taxation of the five zang, and prolonged accumulation of cold leading to taxation. The five taxations as discussed in the Spiritual Pivot are i. excessive use of the eyes which injures the blood, ii. excessive lying down which injures the qi, iii. excessive sitting which injures the flesh, iv. excessive standing which injures the bones, and v. excessive walking which injures the sinews. In later texts, the concept of the five taxations was also used to refer to taxation of each of the five zang. Although also referring to a range of male genital disorders (see [glossary](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/indexes-and-glossary/glossary/f)), the seven injuries in this context are i. overeating which injures the Spleen, ii. great anger which injures the Liver, iii. heavy lifting or prolonged sitting on damp ground which injure the Kidneys, iv. pathogenic cold which injures the Lung, v. worry and anxiety which injure the Heart, vi. wind, rain, cold and summer-heat which injure the body, and vii. excessive fear which injures the emotions.

According to the Essential Questions "The Kidneys store the qi of the bone marrow"[43](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references), "The Kidneys reside in the lumbar region"[44](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references), "The Kidneys generate bone marrow"[45](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references) and " ... when there is internal attack, and heat resides in the Kidneys, then the bones will wither and the marrow will be deficient, therefore the legs will not be able to support the body and bone atrophy disorder will develop"[46](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references). Any Kidney deficiency pattern may give rise to chronic lumbar pain and weakness or soreness of the knees, whilst in cases of Kidney yin deficiency there may be hot sensations in the bones and in case of Kidney yang deficiency, cold sensations of the bones. Located in the lumbar region and having a direct action on the Kidney zang, Shènshū BL-23 is an essential point in the treatment of any kind of lumbar pain which has its root in Kidney deficiency, as well as Kidney deficient atrophy disorder and hemiplegia.

Finally the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories states that Shènshū BL-23 is one of five points ([Fèishū BL-13](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-13), [Xīnshū BL-15](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-15), [Gānshū BL-18](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-18), [Píshū BL-20](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-20) and Shènshū BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".

#### **阐释 (Commentary)**

**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 是肾脏的背俞穴，肾气从内向体表输布。像所有背俞穴一样（特别是脏腑的背俞穴），**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 在最深层次上调理和补益其相应的脏腑。**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 是强肾、固阳、滋阴、益精的主要穴位之一。

根据《灵枢·本神》记载：“肾藏精”，又曰：“精者，生命之源也”。《素问·阴阳应象大论》记载：“精者，人身之本也”，而中医有句俗语强调：“肾为先天之本”。由于精气和先天之气永无过盛之说，肾脏只能表现为虚证。肾虚可能源于先天禀赋，或在人一生中因慢性疾病、耗散、性生活过度、过劳、年老、长期恐惧，或长期其他脏腑失调最终传导至肾而发展。肾虚又细分为以下证型：i. 肾气不固，ii. 肾不纳气，iii. 肾精不足，iv. 肾阳虚，v. 肾阴虚。**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 是治疗所有这些证型的关键穴位。

肾脏主宰二阴（尿道和肛门），并控制膀胱的开合及其气化功能。因此，肾气不足（肾气不固）可能损害肾脏固摄和收敛尿液的能力，导致小便频数、小便淋漓不尽、遗尿、虚劳白浊等漏泄症状。

根据汉代名医华佗的《中藏经》，肾脏“男子则藏精”。因此，肾气不足可能导致精液外泄，表现为遗精、梦遗、尿中含精和早泄。这种漏泄可能发生在单纯气虚（即没有伴随寒热症状）的情况下，也可能作为肾阳虚或肾阴虚的一部分，后者更常见，因为气属广义上的阳。无论何种证型，**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 都是固摄肾脏收敛作用的重要穴位。

肾脏控制全身水液的运行，虽然脾和肺在水液循环中也发挥重要作用，但它们的阳气最终依赖于肾的阳气。这反映在“肾主一身之阳而司水”的论述中。当肾阳不能鼓动水液时，可能出现水肿伴小便不利。《千金方翼方》记载：“**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 治百种水病”（即各种水肿）。

子宫的生长、发育和濡养依赖于肾精，冲脉和任脉都受肾的滋养并根植于肾，《素问·热论》记载：“胞脉者，系于肾”。**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 主治多种子宫疾病，包括肾虚导致月经不调、子宫虚寒导致虚劳、女性“经期性交导致消瘦”和带下。

肾阳与命门（生命之门）之间的密切关系已在众多经典中得到强调。根据《难经》记载：“左肾右命门”，而李东垣则写道：“两肾之间动气者，命门也。”明代张景岳指出“命门居两肾之间”，又曰“命门者，元气之根，水火之宅；无命门则五脏之阴气不得滋长，五脏之阳气不得发越”。因此，肾阳对应命门之火，是全身阳气的源泉。肾阳不能温煦身体，会导致子宫、腰部、腿部和骨骼长期寒冷等症状。肾阳衰退和命门火衰可能导致性功能减退，从而引起阳痿。肾阳也是脾阳的来源。当肾阳不能温煦脾胃之土时，可能出现寒湿久泻、泻下完谷不化、胃部寒胀和呕吐冷水。与此证型相关的腹泻特点是发生在凌晨，被称为五更泻。
《景岳全书》记载：“肺主一身之气，肾为气之根。肺主呼气而肾主纳气。阴阳相交，呼吸乃和。”此引文强调了肾在正常呼吸中的关键作用。肺是最高位的脏腑，具有肃降之气、控制呼气的功能，而肾是最低位的脏腑，具有纳气、控制吸气的功能。如果肾气不足，不能固摄和纳住肺气，则可能出现呼吸困难、哮喘或咳嗽。此证型特点是慢性，通常伴有其他肾虚症状。与肾气不固一样，此证型可能出现无寒热症状，或伴有肾阳虚或肾阴虚。

根据《医宗必读》记载：“人体之水火者，阴阳也……无阳则阴不生，无阴则阳不化”，而《景岳全书》则说：“阴阳一源……火者，水之主也，水者，火之源也……”这些引文强调了肾阴肾阳之间不可分离的关系，并有助于解释为何所有治疗肾脏的穴位都必然能益肾阴肾阳。因此，尽管**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 的主治强调肾气或肾阳不足，但它也具有滋养肾阴的作用。

像肾阳一样，肾阴是全身阴液的根本。肾阴不足可能导致身体失养和虚火上炎，引起消瘦、消渴病以及面部和身体红热等症状。

阴经背俞穴的一个特征是它们滋养和调理其相应的七窍。根据《灵枢·本神》记载：“肾气通于耳；肾和则耳能闻五音”。由于肾藏精，生髓充脑，主阴，**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 不仅主治耳鸣耳聋等耳部疾病，还主治视物模糊、夜盲和视物眩晕，这些都由髓、精或阴虚引起。

由于肾阴肾阳是身体阴液和阳气的根本，这解释了**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 在慢性虚损疾病中的作用。它主治五劳七伤，五脏劳损，以及久寒导致虚劳。五劳在《灵枢》中讨论为：i. 久视伤血，ii. 久卧伤气，iii. 久坐伤肉，iv. 久立伤骨，v. 久行伤筋。在后世文献中，五劳的概念也指五脏的劳损。七伤在此处除了指一系列男性生殖器疾病外（参见词汇表），还指：i. 暴食伤脾，ii. 大怒伤肝，iii. 举重或久坐湿地伤肾，iv. 寒邪伤肺，v. 忧虑伤心，vi. 风、雨、寒、暑伤身，vii. 过度惊恐伤情志。

根据《素问·宣明五气论》记载：“肾藏骨髓之气”，《素问·逆顺肥瘦》记载：“肾者，主腰也”，《素问·六节藏象论》记载：“肾生骨髓”，以及“……内传之，其热当在肾，肾者，水也，而骨枯髓减，故足不任身，骨痿疾成矣。”（此引用为意译，原文略有不同）。任何肾虚证型都可能引起慢性腰痛以及膝部酸软无力，而肾阴虚时可能出现骨骼发热感，肾阳虚时则有骨骼发冷感。**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 位于腰部，直接作用于肾脏，是治疗任何根源于肾虚的腰痛，以及肾虚痿证和偏瘫的关键穴位。

最后，《类经图翼》记载，**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)** 是“泻五脏之热”的五个穴位之一（**[BL13 肺俞](point/BL13.md)**、**[BL15 心俞](point/BL15.md)**、**[BL18 肝俞](point/BL18.md)**、**[BL20 脾俞](point/BL20.md)** 和**[BL23 肾俞](point/BL23.md)**）。
