#### Commentary

Yǎnglǎo SI-6 is the xi-cleft point of the Small Intestine channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain. Yǎnglǎo SI-6 is particularly used for pain of the shoulder, scapula and arm that is so severe that it feels as if they are broken or dislocated. This action extends to its paired taiyang foot (Bladder) channel, and thus Yǎnglǎo SI-6 is also used as a distal point for acute sprain of the lumbar region and for contraction of the sinews and painful obstruction of the foot.

The Small Intestine primary and sinew channels connect with the outer canthus, and the primary channel also connects with the inner canthus. Yǎnglǎo SI-6 is renowned for its use in deficiency-type eye disorders characterised by blurring and dimness of vision, and most authorities explain the name of this point 'Support the Aged' in the light of this action.

#### Summary of clinical application

- Xi-cleft point for acute pain: shoulder pain, pain of the shoulder as if it were broken, pain of the upper arm as if it were dislocated, stiffness and pain of the shoulder and back, numbness of the shoulder and arm, redness and swelling of the exterior aspect of the elbow, heaviness and pain of the lumbar region, difficulty in sitting and rising, contraction of the sinews, painful obstruction of the foot with inability to extend and flex.
