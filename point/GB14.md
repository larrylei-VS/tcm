#### Commentary

In theory, the forehead is most closely associated with the yangming channel. In clinical practice pain of the forehead region may be due to involvement either of yangming channel, in which case it is often accompanied by pain of the infraorbital region (often seen in sinusitis), or of shaoyang channel, in which case it is frequently accompanied by pain of the temporal or parietal regions and eye (often seen in migrainous headaches). Yángbái GB-14 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder shaoyang channel with the Stomach and Large Intestine yangming channels, and is therefore the pre-eminent local point in the treatment of pain of the forehead, whether due to interior disharmony or invasion of exterior pathogenic factors. Some classical sources, for example the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, also imply that Yángbái GB-14 can dispel wind-cold from the body as a whole and recommend it for inability to get warm despite wearing much clothing, and shivering and aversion to cold on the back.

Yángbái GB-14 is also an important local point for the treatment of various diseases of the eyes and eyelids due to a wide range of aetiologies, especially exterior or interior wind, manifesting as lacrimation, deviation of the eye, drooping, twitching or itching of the eyelids, pain and itching of the pupils and night-blindness.

#### Summary of clinical application

- Meeting point of the Gall Bladder, Stomach and Large Intestine channels: important point for pain of the forehead whether extending to the eye, the infraorbital region (e.g. sinusitis) or the temporal or parietal regions.
- Important local point for various diseases of the eyes and eyelids: lacrimation, deviation of the eye, drooping, twitching or itching of the eyelids, pain and itching of the pupils, nightblindness.

#### 1.7. 论述

理论上，前额与阳明经关系最密切。临床上，前额痛可能涉及阳明经，此时常伴有眶下区疼痛（常见于鼻窦炎），或涉及少阳经，此时常伴有颞部或顶侧疼痛及眼痛（常见于偏头痛）。[GB14 阳白](/point/GB14.md)是胆经少阳与胃经、大肠经阳明的交会穴，因此是治疗前额痛的首要局部穴位，无论是由内伤失调还是外感病邪引起。例如，《针灸大成》等经典文献暗示[GB14 阳白](/point/GB14.md)能祛全身风寒，推荐用于多穿衣仍不暖及背部寒战恶寒的情况。
