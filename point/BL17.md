#### Commentary

Géshū BL-17 is the hui-meeting point of blood and, as its name 'Diaphragm Shu' implies, is a kind of honorary back-shu point of the diaphragm, although it is not generally listed as such. These two properties inform its principal actions.

Géshū BL-17 has long been considered a vital point in the treatment of the widest range of blood disorders, indeed many classics simply state that this point can be used for "all blood diseases". Although varied and complex in presentation, disorders of blood may be generalised as being of three main types: blood stasis, blood heat and blood deficiency.

Impairment of blood circulation and consequent blood stasis may be due to stagnation or deficiency of qi, traumatic injury, haemorrhage, penetration of cold, blood deficiency, heat, chronic disease or emotional factors. The variety of symptoms which blood stasis can give rise to is extensive, but of these the principal one is pain. Pain of excess type may be due either to stagnation of qi or stasis of blood, as reflected in the famous adage "without movement there is pain, with movement there is no pain". Pain due to qi stagnation is characterised by a tendency to move and fluctuate, whilst pain due to blood stasis is fixed and stabbing. According to Wang Qing-ren, the Qing dynasty author of Correcting Errors in Medicine "whenever there is pain in the abdomen that does not move, it is blood stasis". Tang Rong-chuan in the Treatise on Disorders of Blood said "... When blood stasis is between the jingluo and the zangfu the whole body is in pain ... when it is in the upper jiao ... there is stabbing obstinate pain of the arm, chest and diaphragm ... when it is in the middle jiao there is pain of the abdomen and lateral costal region". As is clear from its indications, Géshū BL-17 is applicable in all these cases. It should be noted, however, that due to its location and its special action on the diaphragm which intersects the upper and middle jiao, its main sphere of action is on these two areas and it is less used for blood stasis in the lower jiao. Géshū BL-17 is also an important point to treat various kinds of fever due to blood stasis. The Treatise on Disorders of Blood states "when blood stasis is at the level of the pores, the nutritive qi and defensive qi are not harmonised, there is fever accompanied by chills ... when it is half-interior half-exterior ... there is alternating chills and fever ... when it is at the level of the muscles and flesh there will be a burning fever ... when it is in the jingluo and zangfu ... there is necessarily steaming bone consumption fever". Finally, according to Wang Qing-ren in Correcting Errors in Medicine "In the pattern of mania-depression, where there is continual crying and laughing, swearing and singing ... then the qi and blood will coagulate in the brain, the qi of the zangfu are disconnected, [the patient] will be as if in a dream". This quotation emphasises the relationship of blood stasis to severe psycho-emotional disorders. Although Wang Qing-ren ascribes the site of the disease to the brain, as discussed elsewhere (see the [introductory discussion](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-governing-vessel/discussion) preceding the Governing vessel points) there is an overlap between the Heart and brain in the various traditions of Chinese medicine. Whatever the location of the disorder, however, the pathology is similar. Blood stasis may directly disturb the spirit, or alternatively blood stasis may both obstruct the blood vessels and transform to heat. The heat agitates the spirit whilst the blood stasis prevents nourishment by fresh blood from reaching the Heart and brain. The combination of heat and Heart blood deficiency leads to a malnourished and restless spirit.

Géshū BL-17 is an important point for many kinds of bleeding disorders, primarily due to blood heat or blood stasis, including coughing blood, vomiting blood, spitting blood, nosebleed and blood in the stool. Heat entering the blood level may be due to a number of causes including constitutional heat, exterior pathogenic heat, overconsumption of excessively heating food or drink, or heat of excess or deficiency type generated by disharmony of the zangfu. When heat agitates the blood it causes it to move recklessly and burst out of the vessels giving rise to haemorrhage that is usually acute and profuse. Géshū BL-17 is able to cool the blood and stop bleeding, primarily from the upper and middle jiao (Lung and Stomach). Another important cause of haemorrhage is blood stasis. When blood is stagnant and does not move, it accumulates and may be forced out of the vessels, giving rise to haemorrhage characterised by its intermittent nature, dark purplish colour and presence of clots. At the same time, haemorrhage due to any aetiology is itself an important cause of blood stasis, as blood that is forced out of the vessels easily pools and stagnates. This is reflected in the saying "where there is haemorrhage there is stasis". The close inter-relationship of blood heat, blood stasis and haemorrhage is further illustrated by the fact that blood heat may condense and dry the blood giving rise to stasis, as stated in the Treatise on Epidemic Warm Febrile Disease[19](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-bladder-channel/references) "Because latent stagnant fire evaporates the blood's fluid, the blood simmers and forms stasis".

The ability of Géshū BL-17 to nourish blood (and yin) is clearly overshadowed in the classical indications by its ability to resolve blood stasis and heat. There are three areas, however, that reflect its nourishing and tonifying properties. The first is its ability to treat disorders such as night sweating and steaming bone disorder due to severe blood and yin deficiency. The second is the combination of Géshū BL-17 with [Dǎnshū BL-19](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-19) known as the 'four flowers'. The four flowers were first mentioned in Secrets of a Frontier Official by Wang Tao in 752 CE, who did not specify the points but described rather a complex location method. He advised tying a piece of string around the neck, with a knot made at the level of [Jiūwéi REN-15](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-15). When the string is allowed to fall down the back, the knot will then lie on the vertebral column at the crossing point of two diagonal lines the end of each of which leads to one of the four points.

The Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion in the 13th century first defined the four flowers by name as Géshū BL-17 and [Dǎnshū BL-19](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-19) and said that they dominated blood, being indicated (for treatment by moxibustion) for taxation consumption disorder. The third application of the blood nourishing property of Géshū BL-17 is its special ability to treat blood deficiency allied to blood stasis. It has long been understood that following haemorrhage, the consequent blood stasis prevents the formation of new blood. This is reflected in the saying "if blood stasis is not transformed, new blood cannot be generated", and the statement by Tang Rong-chuan in the Treatise on Disorders of Blood "In vomiting blood, nosebleeds and blood in the stool, the blood leaves the channels; any blood that has left the channels is separated and no longer connected with the blood that nourishes the entire body ... this blood is unable to augment with good blood, thus the transformation of new blood is hindered". Thus, by pooling outside the channels, blood stasis may lead directly to blood deficiency as sufficient blood is no longer available to nourish the body.

The action of Géshū BL-17 on painful obstruction (commonly referred to as wind-damp in Chinese medicine) which affects the whole body, reflects its action of regulating blood. Prolonged painful obstruction may give rise either to blood stasis or blood deficiency, whilst blood deficiency may render a person prone to invasion by wind-damp. The importance of treating the blood in such cases is reflected in the saying "to treat wind first treat the blood; once blood moves wind will be dispelled".

As its name 'Diaphragm Shu' implies, Géshū BL-17 has an important action on the diaphragm which lies between the upper and middle jiao. By harmonising the diaphragm, Géshū BL-17 is able to descend rebellious qi of both the Lung in the upper jiao (cough and dyspnoea) and the Stomach in the middle jiao (vomiting, Stomach reflux, hiccup and difficult ingestion). Géshū BL-17 is specifically indicated for oesophageal constriction characterised by difficulty in swallowing and, in the latter stages, by vomiting in the evening what was ingested in the morning, and vomiting in the morning what was ingested the evening before.

Finally, due to its action on the diaphragm and Stomach, and by extension the Spleen, Géshū BL-17 is indicated for various kinds of retained fluid giving rise to symptoms such as heaviness, swelling, distention and pain of the body, weariness of the four limbs, somnolence and cold phlegm of the diaphragm and Stomach.

#### **阐释 (Commentary)**

**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 是血之会穴，正如其名称“膈俞”所示，它是膈的荣誉性背俞穴，尽管通常不这样列出。这两个特性决定了它的主要作用。

**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 长期以来被认为是治疗各种血证的关键穴位，许多经典著作甚至简单地指出此穴可用于“一切血证”。尽管血证表现多样且复杂，但大致可分为三种主要类型：血瘀、血热和血虚。

血液循环受阻并因此产生的血瘀可能由气滞或气虚、外伤、出血、寒邪侵袭、血虚、热邪、慢性病或情志因素引起。血瘀可引起的症状种类繁多，其中最主要的是疼痛。实性疼痛可能由气滞或血瘀引起，正如著名的格言“不通则痛，通则不痛”所反映。气滞引起的疼痛特点是游走不定，而血瘀引起的疼痛则是固定刺痛。清代王清任在《医林改错》中说：“凡腹痛不动者，皆血瘀也。”唐容川在《血证论》中说：“……瘀血在经络脏腑之间，则周身疼痛……在上焦则……臂痛胸膈刺痛顽固不化……在中焦则腹痛胁肋痛。”从其主治可见，**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 适用于所有这些情况。然而需要注意的是，由于其位置及其对贯穿上焦和中焦的膈膜的特殊作用，其主要作用范围限于这两个区域，较少用于下焦血瘀。**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 也是治疗各种血瘀引起的发热的重要穴位。《血证论》记载：“瘀血在腠理，营卫不和，发热兼恶寒……在半表半里……则寒热往来……在肌肉之间，则发烧……在经络脏腑之间……则必有骨蒸劳热。”最后，根据王清任在《医林改错》中对“癫狂”证的描述：“凡有哭笑不停、骂詈唱歌……皆气血凝滞于脑，脏腑之气不相通，[患者]如在梦中。”此引文强调了血瘀与严重精神情志障碍的关系。虽然王清任将病变部位归因于脑，但如别处（参见督脉穴位前的介绍性讨论）所述，中医各流派中，心与脑之间存在重叠。然而，无论病变部位在哪里，其病理是相似的。血瘀可能直接扰乱心神，或者血瘀可能既阻碍血管又化热。热邪扰乱心神，同时血瘀阻止新鲜血液滋养心脏和大脑。热邪与心血不足的结合导致心神失养且躁动不安。

**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 是治疗多种出血性疾病的重要穴位，主要由于血热或血瘀引起，包括咳血、呕血、咯血、鼻出血和便血。热入血分的原因多种多样，包括体质热盛、外感热邪、过量食用辛辣温热食物或脏腑失调产生的实热或虚热。当热邪扰动血液时，会使其妄行并溢出血管，导致通常为急性且量大的出血。**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 能够凉血止血，主要作用于上焦和中焦（肺和胃）的出血。出血的另一个重要原因是血瘀。当血液瘀滞不动时，会积聚并可能被迫溢出血管，导致以间歇性、暗紫色和有血块为特征的出血。同时，任何病因引起的出血本身就是血瘀的重要原因，因为被迫溢出血管的血液容易积聚和瘀滞。这在俗语“离经之血，则为瘀血”中有所体现。血热、血瘀和出血之间的密切相互关系，进一步体现在血热可能凝结和耗伤血液，导致瘀滞，正如《温病条辨》所言：“伏邪之火，煎熬津液，血亦熬成瘀也。”

**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 滋养血液（和阴液）的能力在经典主治中明显不及其化解血瘀和血热的能力。然而，有三个方面反映了其滋养和补益特性。首先是它能够治疗因严重气血阴虚导致的盗汗和骨蒸潮热。其次是**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 与**[BL19 胆俞](point/BL19.md)** 组成的“四花穴”。四花穴最早由唐代王焘在公元752年的《外台秘要》中提及，他没有明确穴位名称，而是描述了一种复杂的定位方法。他建议在颈部系一根绳子，在**[REN15 鸠尾](point/REN15.md)** 水平打一个结。当绳子垂到背部时，结将位于脊柱上，在两条对角线的交点处，每条对角线的末端连接其中一个四花穴。
十三世纪《针灸资生经》首次明确了四花穴的名称为**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 和**[BL19 胆俞](point/BL19.md)**，并指出它们主血，用于治疗虚劳疾病（艾灸）。**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 补血特性的第三个应用是其治疗血虚兼血瘀的特殊能力。长期以来，人们都明白出血后，继发的血瘀会阻碍新血的生成。这反映在俗语“瘀血不去，新血不生”中，以及唐容川在《血证论》中的论述：“咯血、鼻衄、便血，血离经络；凡血离经络，与经血各不相属，不为荣身之血……此血不能益好血，故新血生化为之阻碍。”因此，血瘀积聚于经脉之外，可能直接导致血虚，因为充足的血液不再能滋养身体。

**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 治疗全身痹痛（中医常称为风湿）的作用，反映了其调理血液的作用。长期痹痛可能导致血瘀或血虚，而血虚可能使人易感风湿。在这种情况下，治疗血液的重要性反映在俗语“治风先治血；血行风自灭”中。

正如其名称“膈俞”所示，**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 对位于上焦和中焦之间的膈膜有重要作用。通过调和膈膜，**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 能够肃降上焦肺气（咳嗽和呼吸困难）和中焦胃气（呕吐、胃食管反流、呃逆和吞咽困难）。**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 明确主治噎膈，其特点是吞咽困难，后期表现为晚上呕吐白天所食，早上呕吐晚上所食。

最后，由于其对膈膜和胃，以及延伸至脾脏的作用，**[BL17 膈俞](point/BL17.md)** 主治各种水饮内停，引起身体沉重、肿胀、胀满疼痛、四肢倦怠、嗜睡以及膈胃寒痰等症状。
