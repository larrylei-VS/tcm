#### Commentary

Guānyuán REN-4 is one of the principle acupuncture points to promote and foster the original qi, benefit essence, fortify Kidney yang and nourish Kidney yin. As well as Guanyuan (Gate of Origin) several of the numerous different names given to this point reflect its deeply tonifying properties, for example Mingmen (Gate of Life), Huangzhiyuan (Origin of Huang), Xuehai (Sea of Blood), Qihai (Sea of Qi), Dahai (Great Sea) and of course Dantian (Cinnabar Field). According to classical Chinese thought, the lower dantian, located in the lower abdomen and extending from [Yīnjiāo REN-7](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-7) to Guānyuán REN-4, is the residence of the deepest energies of the body and the source of all movement. According to the Classic of Difficulties [4](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-conception-vessel/references) "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is [the basis] of human life, the source of the five zang and six fu, the root of the twelve channels, the door of respiration and the origin of the sanjiao". According to the Discourse into the Origin and Development of Medicine[5](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-conception-vessel/references) "Original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang. Where is the place of origin of the original qi? The Daoists believe it is dantian".

Due to its location at the heart of the lower dantian (cinnabar field) and its close relationship with the original qi and hence essence, Guānyuán REN-4 is an indispensable point to tonify and nourish the Kidneys. This action is made abundantly clear by the long list of classical indications which reads like a textbook description of Kidney deficiency. The Kidneys dominate the bones and lumbar region, and Guānyuán REN-4 is indicated for weakness, pain and cold sensations of the lumbar region and legs, especially in the middle-aged and elderly. In severe cases Kidney deficiency may give rise to withered ears, darkness of the complexion and Kidney taxation. According to the Essential Questions [6](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-conception-vessel/references) "fear depletes the essence". Fear is closely linked to the Kidneys, and prolonged fear may injure and weaken the Kidneys and the essence, whilst Kidney deficiency may render a person prone to deep-seated fear. The powerful effect that fear may have on the body is reflected in classical sources which ascribe even deep-rooted bone ulcers and deficiency consumption to this aetiology. When the Kidneys are deficient and fail to dominate the Bladder there may be urinary frequency or enuresis. In all such cases Guānyuán REN-4 is of fundamental importance. Guānyuán REN-4 is also used for the condition known as running piglet qi, especially when due to Kidney yang deficiency with invasion of cold. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". Not only may this pattern be induced by fear, but when the qi rushes upwards in this way it can induce uncontrollable anxiety and panic.

The Spleen controls blood, the Liver stores blood, and the Kidneys and the Conception vessel dominate the uterus and conception. Guānyuán REN-4, also known as Sanjiejiao (Triple Intersection), is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with these three channels and is an essential point to regulate the uterus and promote fertility. When Kidney deficiency leads to deficiency and coldness of what is known as the 'palace of the child' (i.e. the uterus) in women there may be infertility, amenorrhoea and cold leucorrhoea. The importance of this point in assisting conception is reflected in further alternative names, for example Zihu (Infant's Door) and Zigong (Infant's Palace). If deficiency of Kidney fire leads to coldness and weakness of the 'essence gate' in men, there may be seminal emission and impotence.

According to the True Lineage of Medicine [7](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-conception-vessel/references) "When Kidney origin (yuan) is abundant, then life is long, when Kidney origin (yuan) is in decline, life is short". For this reason, traditional health preservation practitioners in China recommend the regular application of moxibustion to Guānyuán REN-4 in later life.

The strong tonifying and nourishing action of Guānyuán REN-4 is not limited to the Kidneys alone. Since the Kidneys are the root of both the yin and yang of the body, and "the original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang", Guānyuán REN-4 may be used in the treatment of any profound deficiency of the zangfu, whether of qi, blood, yin or yang. Thus, for example, when the yin of the Kidneys and Lung is deficient, Guānyuán REN-4 may be used to treat taxation heat, deficiency consumption with cough, tidal fever with coughing of blood, Kidney deficiency dyspnoea, dyspnoea with inability to lie down, and wasting and thirsting disorder. When the Kidney fire fails to provide sufficient heat for the Spleen's transportation and transformation function there may be chronic diarrhoea, incontinence of the stool in the elderly, lethargy, weakness of the four limbs and undigested food (in the stool).

The action of Guānyuán REN-4 is not limited to tonifying deficiency, however. If exterior cold attacks the lower abdomen, and particularly the Liver channel, especially when there is underlying yang deficiency, there may be severe twisting lower abdominal pain radiating to the genitals and sudden painful shan disorder. These symptoms are commonly ascribed to disharmony of the Small Intestine (Small Intestine qi pain), and this is the principal significance of the status of Guānyuán REN-4 as the front-mu point of the Small Intestine.

When damp-heat knots the Bladder there may be various kinds of urinary disorders characterised by frequency, urgency, pain and dark or bloody urination as well as an intense sensation of heat in the hypogastrium. Guānyuán REN-4 may be used to drain these excess pathogenic factors. According to Zhu Dan-xi "When the Kidneys are deficient the Bladder will generate heat", whilst the General Treatise on the Aetiology and Symptomatology of Diseases[8](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-conception-vessel/references) says "Where painful urinary dysfunction is concerned there is Kidney deficiency and Bladder heat". Guānyuán REN-4 is especially indicated when, as is commonly the case, deficiency and excess co-exist and there is underlying Kidney deficiency. Guānyuán REN-4 is also an important point in the treatment of post-partum disorders such as pain and persistent flow of lochia, which are also frequently due to a combination of deficiency and excess.

Finally, due to its powerful ability to restore the yang, Guānyuán REN-4 is used to treat collapse of yang characterised by chills, breathlessness, minute pulse, profuse sweating and unconsciousness. In such cases, Guānyuán REN-4, in combination with [Qìhǎi REN-6](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-6) and [Shénquè REN-8](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-8), is treated by continuous indirect moxibustion.

#### 1.6. 论述

[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)是促进和培植元气、益精、补肾阳、滋肾阴的主要穴位之一。其别名如“命门”“黄之原”“血海”“气海”“大海”及“丹田”均反映其深层补益特性。按传统中医思想，下丹田位于下腹，从[REN7 阴交](point/REN7.md)至[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)，是体内最深能量的居所及一切运动的源泉。《难经》称：“肾间动气，人之生命，五脏六腑之本，十二经之根，呼吸之门，三焦之原。”《医源论》谓：“元气分布五脏，成五脏之精。元气发源何处？道家以为丹田。”  

因位于下丹田核心并与元气及精密切相关，[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)是补益滋肾的不可或缺穴位。其经典指征如教科书般描述肾虚：肾主骨及腰，[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)用于中老年腰腿无力、疼痛及冷感，严重时耳枯、面色暗及肾劳。《素问》称：“恐则伤精。”恐与肾相关，长期恐惧可伤肾及精，肾虚则易深层恐惧。经典认为恐惧甚至可致深层骨疡及虚耗。若肾虚不主膀胱，可致尿频或遗尿，[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)在此至关重要。[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)也用于奔豚气，尤因肾阳虚伴寒侵。《金匮要略》称：“奔豚病起于下腹，冲喉甚急，患者如死，攻发即止，因惊恐而起。”此模式不仅由恐惧引发，且气上冲时可诱发难以控制的焦虑及惊恐。  

脾主血，肝藏血，肾及任脉主子宫与受孕。[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)，又称“三结交”，为任脉与此三经交会穴，是调子宫及促孕的关键穴。肾虚致“子宫”虚寒，可致不孕、闭经及冷带下。其助孕重要性见于别名如“子户”“子宫”。若肾火虚致“精关”虚寒无力，可致遗精及阳痿。  

《医真传》谓：“肾元盛则寿长，肾元衰则寿短。”因此，中国传统养生者推荐晚年定期灸[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)。  

[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)的强补益作用不限于肾。肾为阴阳之根，“元气分布五脏，成五脏之精”，[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)可用于任何脏腑深层虚证（气、血、阴阳）。如肾肺阴虚，可治劳热、虚耗咳嗽、潮热咳血、肾虚气喘及消渴症。肾火不足碍脾运化，可致慢性腹泻、老年便失禁、嗜睡、四肢无力及泻下未消化食物。  

[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)作用不仅限于补虚。若外寒攻下腹，尤肝经，伴阳虚，可致下腹剧绞痛放射至生殖器及突发疝痛，常归于小肠失调（小肠气痛），此为其作为小肠募穴的主要意义。  

若膀胱湿热结聚，可致尿频、尿急、尿痛、尿暗或血尿及下腹剧热。[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)可泻这些实邪。朱丹溪谓：“肾虚则膀胱生热。”《诸病源候论》称：“淋病，肾虚膀胱热。”[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)尤适用于常见虚实兼夹、肾虚为本的情况。[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)也是治疗产后疾患如疼痛及恶露不尽的重要穴位，常因虚实并存。  

因其强回阳作用，[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)用于阳气衰竭引起的寒战、气喘、脉微、汗出及昏迷，常与[REN6 气海](point/REN6.md)及[REN8 神阙](point/REN8.md)配伍，持续间接灸治。  

#### 1.7. 临床应用总结
