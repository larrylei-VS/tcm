#### Commentary

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 (Leg Three Miles) is the he-sea and earth point of the Stomach earth channel. It was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'[20](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references), his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for cold in the Stomach, borborygmus and diarrhoea, swelling of the leg, pain of the knee, emaciation due to injury by cold and all parasitic diseases. The Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion by the Ming dynasty author Gao Wu includes Zúsānlǐ ST-36 among the 'four command points' (for disorders of the abdomen). Qin Cheng-zu of the Song dynasty declared that by using the point Zúsānlǐ ST-36 "all diseases can be treated".

The term 'li' in the name Zusanli may variously be interpreted as meaning a measure of distance (a Chinese mile) or as a homonym for 'to rectify'. The former interpretation reflects the idea that stimulating Zúsānlǐ ST-36 would enable a person to walk a further three li, even when exhausted, as well as that the point is located three cun below the knee. The latter interpretation reflects the concept that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is able to rectify either the three vital zangfu (Stomach, Spleen and Kidneys) or the three jiao (upper, middle and lower).

The Classic of Difficulties[21](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references)recommended the use of the he-sea points for "counterflow qi and diarrhoea", whilst the Spiritual Pivot[22](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) not only recommended their use for diseases of the internal fu, but also stated "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point". Zúsānlǐ ST-36 may be used in the treatment of any disorder of the Stomach fu, whether due to cold or heat, deficiency or excess, stagnation and retention of food, fluid or blood etc. Under normal conditions the Stomach has the function of receiving food and drink, "rotting and ripening" them, and descending the products of digestion. When these functions are impaired, which can be due to any of the above patterns, two principal disharmonies may appear: i. Stomach qi may fail to descend, leading to stagnation of qi and food and giving rise to epigastric or abdominal fullness, distention and pain, poor appetite etc. or ii. Stomach qi may rebel upwards giving rise to nausea, vomiting, belching, hiccup and difficult ingestion. In the case of Stomach heat there may be excessive hunger, whilst in the case of Stomach yin deficiency there may be hunger without desire to eat. In any one of these possible disorders of the Stomach, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is indicated.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36, the earth point of the Stomach channel, also has a profound effect on regulating its coupled earth zang, the Spleen, and is able to strengthen the Spleen's function of transforming and transporting both food essence and fluid. As such it is an important point for the treatment of diarrhoea or dysenteric disorder, borborygmus, oedema, inability to urinate and heaviness of the limbs. Its important action on all disorders of the intestines, which are dominated by the Spleen, is reflected in the Spiritual Pivot[23](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) which advises the use of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 "when the intestines do not function correctly; if it is full reduce it, if it is empty reinforce it". It should be emphasised that the ability of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 to transform damp derives from its primary action of tonifying the Spleen. This differentiates Zúsānlǐ ST-36 from a point such as [Yīnlíngquán SP-9](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/SP-9) where the action of transforming damp is primary.

The Stomach and Spleen in the middle jiao are the root of the post-heaven qi and the prime source for the production of qi and blood and the continual supplementation of the pre-heaven essence. This vital role is emphasised in countless statements found in the ancient classics such as "The Stomach is the root of the zangfu"[24](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references), "The five zang and six fu all receive qi from the Stomach"[25](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references), "The Stomach is the sea of qi and blood"[26](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references), as well as traditional sayings such as "Stomach qi is the root of man". Another saying "With Stomach qi there is life, without Stomach qi there is death" emphasises the vital importance of assessing the state of the Stomach qi (manifested by the patient's appetite and digestion) in prognosis. It is said that even in serious disease, strong Stomach qi is an encouraging prognostic sign, whilst in a less serious disease, exhaustion of Stomach qi is a poor prognostic sign. This principle is reinforced in the Essential Questions[27](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) which says "Water and grain are the root of human life; without water and grain a person will die, as one will die when Stomach qi is absent from the pulse". In the chapter 'Discourse On the Seas' in the Spiritual Pivot[28](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references), Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is given as the lower point of the 'sea of water and grain' ([Qìchōng ST-30](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-30) is the upper point). According to this passage, when the sea of water and grain is in excess, there is abdominal fullness, and when it is deficient there is hunger with inability to eat.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is the single most important point in the body to stimulate the action of the Stomach and Spleen in generating qi and blood. The post-heaven qi derives from the interaction of the grain qi (extracted from food and drink by the Spleen and Stomach) and the clear qi of air (transformed by the Lung), with the assistance of the original qi. Zúsānlǐ ST-36 alone is an important point to tonify the qi of the whole body, or in combination with [Tàiyuān LU-9](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LU-9) (the earth point of the Lung metal channel) to tonify the Lung qi according to the principle of 'cultivating the earth to generate metal'. It is indicated for insufficiency of original qi, deficient dyspnoea, dyspnoea with inability to stand for long, coughing and shortness of breath. By virtue of its action of tonifying qi, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also able to nourish the blood and is indicated for palpitations, dimness of vision, dizziness and post-partum blood dizziness.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also renowned for its ability to support the correct qi. This is expressed in the recommendation by Sun Si-miao to apply regular moxibustion to Zúsānlǐ ST-36 to preserve and maintain health, and in the ancient proverb (quoted for example by the 13th century doctor Wang Zhi-zhong) "if you wish to be safe never allow Sanli (ST-36) to become dry", referring to the prophylactic use of moxibustion. This saying implies that a constant suppurating sore should be maintained at Zúsānlǐ ST-36 through the repeated use of burning moxibustion. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also emphasises the profound tonifying effect of this point by stating "frequently moxa Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and [Qìhǎi REN-6](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-6) in young people whose qi is feeble" whilst Ma Dan-yang advocates regular needling and moxibustion at Zúsānlǐ ST-36 for those who have passed the age of thirty. It is sometimes suggested that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 should not be needled in case of attack by exterior pathogens, since its effect of reinforcing the correct qi may also reinforce the pathogen. In this respect, however, it is interesting to note that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is classically indicated for chills and fever, febrile disease with absence of sweating, and febrile disease with heavy head and pain of the forehead.

The great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo is said to have valued the use of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 to treat the five taxations and the seven injuries. The five taxations as discussed in the Spiritual Pivot[29](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) are i. excessive use of the eyes which injures the blood, ii. excessive lying down which injures the qi, iii. excessive sitting which injures the flesh, iv. excessive standing which injures the bones, and v. excessive walking which injures the sinews. In later texts, the concept of the five taxations was also used to refer to taxation of each of the five zang[30](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references). Although also referring to a range of male genital disorders (see [glossary](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/indexes-and-glossary/glossary/s)), the seven injuries in this context are i. overeating which injures the Spleen, ii. great anger which injures the Liver, iii. heavy lifting or prolonged sitting on damp ground which injure the Kidneys, iv. pathogenic cold which injures the Lung, v. worry and anxiety which injure the Heart, vi. wind, rain, cold and summer-heat which injure the body, and vii. excessive fear which injures the emotions.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also indicated classically for insufficiency of both original qi and yin. Original qi originates in the Kidneys but is dependent on the post-heaven qi of the Stomach and Spleen. The Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach by Li Dong-yuan says "Sufficiency of original qi is dependent on the qi of the Spleen and Stomach being free of injury; only then can the original qi be supplemented and nourished". As far as deficiency of yin is concerned, according to Secrets of a Frontier Official "When a person passes the age of thirty, if moxa is not applied to Zúsānlǐ ST-36 then the qi will rise and rush to the eyes". This statement emphasises that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also able to supplement the inevitable decline of Kidney yin that occurs with advancing age, and thus prevent pathologically ascending yang from rushing to the head and eyes.

The Stomach divergent channel connects with the Heart, whilst the Stomach primary channel meets with the Governing vessel (and thus the brain) at [Shéntíng DU-24](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/DU-24) and [Rénzhōng DU-26](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/DU-26). If yangming fire blazes out of control it may be transmitted along these channels to the Heart and brain and agitate the spirit. Heart fire may be complicated by phlegm, which usually derives from prolonged dampness or from condensation of body fluids by fire. Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is able to clear yangming fire and, due to its influence on the Spleen, to resolve dampness and transform phlegm. This renders it effective in treating a wide variety of mental disturbances, especially those characterised by manic behaviour, for example mania-depression, manic singing, raving, abusive talk, anger and fright and outrageous laughter. One alternative name for Zúsānlǐ ST-36 given in the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories is Guixie (Ghost Evil), underlining its ability to treat mental disorders. In addition, since blood is the material basis for the Heart to house the spirit, the blood enhancing property of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 also renders it effective to treat emotional disorders arising from Heart blood deficiency. More widely, due to the pathway of the Stomach channel in the upper body, Zúsānlǐ ST-36, like [Fēnglóng ST-40](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-40), is indicated for pain of the Heart and chest, especially when due to blood stasis.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is an important point to treat disorders of the Stomach channel, including swelling, pain and abscess of the breast as well as pain of the thigh and shin. The fact that yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood, allied with the inherent nourishing quality of this point, renders Zúsānlǐ ST-36 a vital point in the treatment of disorders of the lower limb as a whole, especially atrophy disorder and hemiplegia. This is emphasised in the Essential Questions which states "When there is illness in the Spleen it fails to transport body fluids for the Stomach. The four limbs do not receive the nourishment of water and grain and therefore become weak. There is no free flow through the vessel-pathways and there is no qi to engender the sinews, bones and muscles which therefore cannot function"[31](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references). Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is no less important in the treatment of painful obstruction due to cold and dampness, especially when chronic in nature. The Spiritual Pivot[32](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references)says "for damp painful obstruction that is not expelled, for chronic cold that does not cease, choose Zúsānlǐ ST-36". In the treatment of atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is frequently combined in the chain and lock method with other points of the Stomach yangming channel such as [Bìguān ST-31](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-31) and [Jiěxī ST-41](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-41).

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc. The Essential Questions[33](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) includes Zúsānlǐ ST-36 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach (bilateral [Qìchōng ST-30](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-30), Zúsānlǐ ST-36, [Shàngjùxū ST-37](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-37) and [Xiàjùxū ST-39](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-39)).

In conclusion, such is the range of actions and indications of this singular point, that it barely seems an exaggeration to state, as did Qin Cheng-zu nearly a thousand years ago, that by the use of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 "all diseases can be treated".

#### 阐释 (Commentary)

[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) (Leg Three Miles) 是胃土经的合穴和土穴。它被金代名医马丹阳列为“十一穴天星穴”之一，是他最重要的穴位组合，他指出此穴主治胃寒、肠鸣腹泻、腿部肿胀、膝关节疼痛、伤寒消瘦和所有寄生虫病。《针灸大成》的作者高武也将[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 列为“四总穴”之一（肚腹三里留）。宋代秦承祖宣称使用[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)“诸病皆治”。

“三里”之“里”字，可解释为距离单位（中国里），也可解释为“调理”的谐音。前一种解释反映了刺激[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 能使人即使疲惫也能多走三里路，以及此穴位于膝下三寸。后一种解释反映了[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 能够调理三脏（胃、脾、肾）或三焦（上、中、下）。

《难经》推荐合穴用于“逆气而泄”，而《灵枢》不仅推荐其用于内腑疾病，还指出“病在胃，及以饮食不节，邪在肠胃，皆调于合。”[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 可用于治疗胃腑的任何疾病，无论是寒热、虚实、食滞、水饮或血瘀等。在正常情况下，胃有受纳水谷、“腐熟”水谷、下传消化产物的功能。当这些功能受损时，可能出现两种主要的失调：i. 胃气不能下降，导致气滞食积，引起胃脘或腹部胀满、疼痛、食欲不振等；ii. 胃气上逆，引起恶心、呕吐、嗳气、呃逆和吞咽困难。胃热时可能出现多食易饥，胃阴虚时可能出现饥不欲食。在任何一种可能的胃部疾病中，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 都可使用。

[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)，作为胃经的土穴，对调理其表里脾土之脏有深远影响，能够增强脾脏运化水谷精微和水液的功能。因此，它是治疗腹泻或痢疾、肠鸣、水肿、小便不利和四肢沉重的重要穴位。它对所有肠道疾病（脾主运化）的重要作用反映在《灵枢》中，该篇建议“肠不和者，取[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)，实则泻之，虚则补之”。需要强调的是，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 化湿的能力源于其补脾的主要作用。这使[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 与[SP9 阴陵泉](/point/SP9.md) 等穴位不同，后者化湿作用是主要的。

中焦的脾胃是后天之气的根本，是气血生化和先天之精不断补充的主要来源。这一关键作用在无数古籍中都有强调，如“胃者，五脏六腑之本也”，“五脏六腑皆受气于胃”，“胃者，气血之海也”，以及“胃气乃人身之本”等传统说法。另一句俗语“有胃气则生，无胃气则死”强调了评估胃气状态（表现为患者的食欲和消化）在预后中的关键重要性。据说即使是重病，胃气强盛也是一个令人鼓舞的预后信号，而轻病中胃气衰竭则预后不良。这一原则在《素问》中得到强化，其中记载“水谷者，人之所生，水谷不入则死，脉无胃气亦死”。在《灵枢·卫气失常》篇中，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 被列为“水谷之海”的下点（[ST30 气冲](/point/ST30.md) 是上点）。根据该篇记载，水谷之海有余时，腹部胀满；不足时，则饥饿而不能进食。

[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 是全身激发脾胃生化气血作用的最重要穴位。后天之气源于谷气（脾胃从饮食中摄取）与清气（肺所转化）的相互作用，并有元气的协助。[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 单用是补全身之气的重要穴位，或与[LU9 太渊](/point/LU9.md)（肺金经的土穴）联合使用，根据“培土生金”的原则补益肺气。它主治元气不足、虚性呼吸困难、喘息不能久站、咳嗽气短。凭借其补气作用，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 也能养血，主治心悸、视物模糊、眩晕和产后血晕。

[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 也以其扶正固本的能力而闻名。这体现在孙思邈建议经常灸[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 以养生保健，以及古代谚语（如十三世纪医家王国瑞所引）“若要安，三里常不干”，指灸法预防保健之用。这句俗语暗示应通过反复施灸使[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 处保持常年化脓的疮口。
《针灸大成》也强调此穴的深远补益作用，指出“年轻人气虚，常灸[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 和[REN6 气海](/point/REN6.md)”，而马丹阳提倡三十岁以上者经常针刺和艾灸[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)。有时有人认为，在外邪侵袭时，不应针刺[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)，因为其扶正作用也可能助长邪气。然而，在这方面，有趣的是[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 在经典中主治恶寒发热、热病无汗以及热病头重额痛。

汉代名医华佗据说重视用[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 治疗五劳七伤。五劳在《灵枢》中讨论为：i. 久视伤血，ii. 久卧伤气，iii. 久坐伤肉，iv. 久立伤骨，v. 久行伤筋。在后世文献中，五劳的概念也指五脏的劳损。七伤在此处除了指一系列男性生殖器疾病外（参见词汇表），还指：i. 暴食伤脾，ii. 大怒伤肝，iii. 举重或久坐湿地伤肾，iv. 寒邪伤肺，v. 忧虑伤心，vi. 风、雨、寒、暑伤身，vii. 过度惊恐伤情志。

[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 在经典中也主治元气和阴气不足。元气源于肾，但依赖于脾胃的后天之气。《脾胃论》中李东垣说：“元气之充足，赖脾胃之气不伤；然后元气得补而养也。”至于阴虚，根据《千金翼方》记载：“人过三十，若不灸[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)，则气上冲目。”这句话强调[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 还能补充随着年龄增长而不可避免的肾阴衰退，从而防止病理上亢的阳气上冲头目。

胃经别连接心脏，而胃经正经在[DU24 神庭](/point/DU24.md) 和[DU26 人中](/point/DU26.md) 处与督脉（从而与脑）交会。如果阳明火炽盛失控，可能沿这些经脉传导至心和脑，扰乱神志。心火可能伴有痰，痰通常源于长期湿盛或火邪炼液成痰。[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 能够清阳明火，并凭借其对脾脏的影响，化湿化痰。这使其在治疗多种精神障碍方面有效，特别是以狂躁行为为特征的，例如癫狂、狂歌、狂言谵语、詈骂、恼怒惊恐和狂笑。[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 在《类经图翼》中的一个别名是“鬼邪”，强调其治疗精神疾病的能力。此外，由于血是心藏神的物质基础，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 补益气血的作用也使其能有效治疗心血不足引起的情志障碍。更广泛地说，由于胃经在身体上部的循行，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)，像[ST40 丰隆](/point/ST40.md) 一样，主治心胸疼痛，特别是因血瘀所致者。

[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 是治疗胃经疾病的重要穴位，包括乳房肿胀、疼痛和乳痈，以及大腿和小腿疼痛。阳明经多气多血，加上此穴固有的滋养特性，使[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 成为治疗整个下肢疾病的关键穴位，特别是痿证和半身不遂。这在《素问·痹论》中有所强调，其中记载“脾病不能为胃行其津液，四肢不得禀水谷气，则肢体不强，筋骨肌肉皆无气以生，故不能动也。”（此引用为意译，原文略有不同）。[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 在治疗因寒湿导致的痹证方面同样重要，特别是慢性痹证。《灵枢·官能》记载“湿痹不治，久寒不止，取[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)。”在治疗痿证和痹证时，[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 常与[ST31 髀关](/point/ST31.md) 和[ST41 解溪](/point/ST41.md) 等胃阳明经穴位联合使用，采用“链锁法”。

《回阳九针歌》中列举了[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 用于治疗亡阳证，表现为昏厥、恶寒、四肢厥逆、口唇青紫等。《素问·热论》将[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) 列为清胃热的八个穴位之一（双侧[ST30 气冲](/point/ST30.md)、[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)、[ST37 上巨虚](/point/ST37.md) 和[ST39 下巨虚](/point/ST39.md)）。

总之，此穴的作用范围和主治如此之广，以至于正如近千年前秦承祖所言，使用[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md) “诸病皆治”，这几乎不算夸张。

足三里（ST36）作为中医里的“长寿穴”和“第一大要穴”，不仅在传统医学中地位显赫，也是现代经络研究中最深入、成果最多的穴位之一。
作为针灸专业的学生，你可以从以下三个维度来深度理解足三里：

### 一、 传统中医视角：后天之本的“开关”

- **定位与属性**：足阳明胃经之**合穴**，亦是胃之**下合穴**。在针灸理论中，“合治内府”，足三里直接通向胃腑。
- **核心功用**：调理脾胃、补中益气、通经活络、疏风化湿。它是补益后天之本、化生气血的关键点。
    


### 二、 现代科学研究：从“经络”到“神经-免疫回路”

在现代科学语境下，足三里的功用不再是模糊的“气”，而是被还原为具体的神经解剖结构和分子信号通路。
#### 1. 抗炎机制的“金标准”：马秋富团队的研究
这是近年针灸界最重磅的研究（发表于《Nature》）。哈佛大学马秋富团队证实，刺激足三里可以特异性地激活一组名为 **PROKR2** 的感觉神经元。

- **迷走神经-肾上腺轴**：低强度电针刺激足三里，会通过这组神经元激活迷走神经，进而驱动肾上腺释放多巴胺，抑制全身炎症（如细胞因子风暴）。
- **部位特异性**：研究发现，这种抗炎通路在腹部的穴位（如天枢）并不存在，这从现代神经科学角度解释了“穴位特异性”。
    
#### 2. 胃肠动力的高级调节

- **脑肠轴调节**：研究表明针刺足三里能调节中枢神经系统（如迷走神经背侧复合体），通过释放乙酰胆碱等神经递质，双向调节胃肠平滑肌。
- **胃电节律**：fMRI（功能性磁共振成像）研究发现，针刺足三里能即时激活大脑内负责自主神经调节的区域（如前扣带回），改善胃电慢波频率。
    
#### 3. 免疫抑制与增强

- 足三里被证明能调节 T 细胞和 B 细胞的活性。对于脓毒症等急性炎症，它能抑制促炎因子（TNF-α, IL-6）；而对于免疫低下者，它又能通过神经-内分泌网络提升机体的防御能力。
    

### 三、 实际体现：临床上的“双向良性调节”

在临床实践中，足三里的威力体现在它的**智能调节**特性上：

|**临床应用**|**实际体现（机理）**|
|---|---|
|**胃肠双向调节**|当胃蠕动过快（腹泻、痉挛）时，针刺可缓解；当胃蠕动过慢（便秘、胃下垂）时，针刺可促进。|
|**术后康复**|现代外科常用于**术后肠麻痹**。针刺足三里能显著缩短患者术后排气时间，促进肠鸣音恢复。|
|**镇痛效应**|针对慢性痛症，足三里通过激活内源性阿片肽系统（内啡肽释放），提高痛阈。|
|**抗疲劳与增强体质**|在运动医学中，艾灸或按摩足三里能降低血乳酸水平，提升骨骼肌的抗氧化能力，体现了其“强壮要穴”的作用。|
### 学习建议
作为学生，你在临床操作时可以多观察 **“得气”** 感。现代研究发现，足三里的神经分布极其丰富（深层有腓深神经，浅层有外侧皮神经），只有当针尖触及特定筋膜层或神经支诱发酸麻胀感时，上述的神经-免疫级联反应才最强烈。

马秋富教授（哈佛大学医学院教授）于2021年在《Nature》上发表的论文《A neuroanatomical basis for electroacupuncture to drive the vagal–adrenal axis》，是针灸现代研究的里程碑。

它最核心的贡献在于：**用现代神经解剖学证据，解释了为什么“足三里”能抗炎，以及为什么“刺激强度”和“刺激部位”如此关键。**

以下是该论文中关于不同刺激强度与抗炎效果的详细解读：

---

### 1. 核心解剖基础：PROKR2 神经元

研究发现，足三里（ST36）深层的**深筋膜（Deep Fascia）**中，密集分布着一种表达 **PROKR2** 蛋白的感觉神经元。
- **关键结论**：如果破坏掉这些神经元，无论如何电针刺激足三里，都无法产生抗炎效果。
- **穴位特异性**：腹部的穴位（如天枢 ST25）深层几乎没有这种神经元，因此在相同强度下，刺激天枢无法激活下文提到的抗炎轴。

### 2. 不同刺激强度的“分水岭”效应
论文中对比了**低强度（0.5mA）**和**高强度（3.0mA）**电针刺激在细胞因子风暴（全身炎症）模型中的表现。
#### A. 低强度刺激（0.5mA）：激活“迷走神经-肾上腺轴”
这是最理想的**抗炎模式**。
- **通路**：刺激足三里 → 激活 PROKR2 神经元 → 信号传导至延髓（DMV，迷走神经背核）→ 迷走神经传入信号 → **驱动肾上腺释放多巴胺**。
- **结果**：多巴胺能显著抑制全身炎症因子（如 TNF-α, IL-6）。
- **特点**：这种刺激通常不足以引起明显的疼痛或剧烈肌肉收缩，但能精准“唤醒”抗炎轴。
    

#### B. 高强度刺激（3.0mA）：激活“脊髓交感神经反射”

当强度提升到 3.0mA 时，情况变得复杂且具有“双刃剑”性质。
- **通路**：由于强度高，除了激活迷走神经，还会激活**脊髓交感神经反射**。
- **结果**：交感神经释放去甲肾上腺素。
- **效应切换**：
    
    - **预防性刺激（炎症前）**：如果此时机体还没发生炎症，高强度刺激反而可能产生**促炎效应**。
    - **治疗性刺激（炎症中）**：如果在炎症已经发生时进行高强度刺激，它可以通过交感神经系统产生另一种形式的抗炎作用，但机制与迷走神经轴不同。

### 3. 时间窗口：刺激时机的重要性

研究中有一个非常震撼的发现：

- **炎症发生前**：如果先进行高强度电针刺激，随后诱发炎症，实验小鼠的死亡率反而会**升高**。
- **炎症发生后**：如果在炎症已经高峰时进行高强度刺激，却能起到**保护作用**。
这解释了为什么临床上针灸的“量学”和“时机”如此重要：**错误的强度在错误的时机，可能适得其反。**

### 4. 对临床实践（中医学生）的启示

作为针灸学生，这篇论文为你提供了几个极其硬核的支撑：

1. **“得气”的现代本质**：论文提到的 PROKR2 神经元主要分布在**深筋膜**而非皮肤。这有力地证明了，针刺必须达到一定的**深度**（刺入筋膜层）并产生**酸麻胀感**（激活深层感觉神经元），才能触发布局全身的抗炎效应。
2. **手法不是越重越好**：马教授的研究表明，**低强度**的电针足以通过迷走神经驱动抗炎反应。在治疗全身性炎症或免疫紊乱时，温柔而持续的刺激（0.5mA）可能比追求强烈痛感的重刺激更科学。
3. **穴位不能随便替代**：研究证实，腹部穴位因为缺乏 PROKR2 神经元，在驱动迷走-肾上腺抗炎轴方面，确实不如足三里。
    


### 总结对照表

|**维度**|**低强度 (0.5mA)**|**高强度 (3.0mA)**|
|---|---|---|
|**主要神经轴**|迷走神经-肾上腺轴|脊髓交感神经反射|
|**关键神经元**|PROKR2 感觉神经元|广谱感觉神经元|
|**主要介质**|多巴胺 (Dopamine)|去甲肾上腺素 (Noradrenaline)|
|**抗炎效果**|稳定、特异性强|视时间而定（炎症前可能促炎）|
|**解剖位置**|必须是足三里等四肢穴位|全身多处穴位均可诱发|
