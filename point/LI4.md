#### Commentary

Hégǔ LI-4 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'[6](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-large-intestine-channel/references), his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for headache, swelling of the face, malaria with chills and fever, tooth decay, nosebleed and lockjaw with inability to speak. The Ming dynasty author Gao Wu in his work Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also recognised the supreme importance of this point and included it among his 'four command points' (for the face and mouth). Some hundreds of years later it is still probably the best known and most commonly used of the acupuncture points.

Hégǔ LI-4 is a primary point to expel wind-cold or wind-heat and to release the exterior. It may be useful in this respect to view the yang Large Intestine channel as the exterior reflection of the yin Lung channel with which it is coupled. The Lung dominates the exterior by virtue of its function of controlling the skin and body hair and spreading the defensive qi. Attack by exterior pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat which disrupts the exterior portion of the Lung system therefore, may be treated via points of the Large Intestine channel, most notably by Hégǔ LI-4. Thus the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends this point for "injury by cold, headache, rigid spine, and absence of sweating". This is the classic presentation of wind-cold binding the exterior portion of the body. The basic principle in Chinese medicine for the treatment of this condition is to release the exterior by inducing sweating, thereby expelling the pathogen along with the sweat and facilitating the circulation of defensive qi. In fact, Hégǔ LI-4 may also be used for injury by any exterior pathogenic factor which is accompanied by sweating (in this case pathological sweating which does not serve to expel the pathogenic factor). This dual action of Hégǔ LI-4 on both inducing and stopping sweating is reflected by the advice given in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion to reinforce Hégǔ LI-4 and reduce [Fùliū KID-7](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/KID-7) if there is no sweating, and to reduce Hégǔ LI-4 and reinforce [Fùliū KID-7](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/KID-7) in cases with copious sweating. The explanation of this apparently contradictory function is that Hégǔ LI-4 is able to regulate defensive qi and hence adjust the pores, whatever the pattern, indeed some authorities go so far as to attribute to Hégǔ LI-4 the ability to tonify the defensive qi.

The passage from the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion quoted above includes the symptom of 'great thirst', which is clearly not typical of exterior patterns (where the fever and thirst are still relatively mild). This does, however, reflect the common use of Hégǔ LI-4, especially in combination with [Qūchí LI-11](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-11), to reduce high fever of whatever aetiology.

Hégǔ LI-4 is the single most important point to treat disorders of the face and sense organs. This has been emphasised in numerous classics, for example the Classic of the Jade Dragon states "Hégǔ LI-4 treats all diseases of the head, face, ears, eyes, nose, cheeks, mouth and teeth". This point is essential in the treatment of any disorder affecting these areas - whether acute or chronic, hot or cold, deficient or excess - but is least used clinically for disorders of the ears. As far as headaches are concerned, Hégǔ LI-4 is considered appropriate in the treatment of headache in any location due to attack by exterior pathogens, and most particularly any frontal (yangming channel) headache. In clinical practice, however, it is used even more widely, for example the Classic of the Jade Dragon recommended Hégǔ LI-4 for one-sided or generalised headache, whilst the Ode of the Jade Dragon more specifically recommended Hégǔ LI-4 for head wind without phlegm, and [Fēngchí GB-20](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-20) for head wind with phlegm. The affinity of Hégǔ LI-4 for both the forehead and the side of the head reflects the fact that the internal pathway of the Large Intestine channel meets with the Gall Bladder channel at [Yángbái GB-14](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-14), [Xuánlú GB-5](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-5) and [Xuánlí GB-6](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-6).

Hégǔ LI-4 is considered to have a particular ability to ease pain, especially in the areas discussed above, and is a commonly used point in acupuncture analgesia. According to Chinese medicine, pain of excess type arises when impaired circulation of qi and blood leads to stagnation. This is expressed in the saying "without movement there is pain, with movement there is no pain". The special ability of Hégǔ LI-4 to treat pain is explained by the statement in the Spiritual Pivot[7](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-large-intestine-channel/references) "Yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood". This emphasises the particular ability of points on the Large Intestine and Stomach (yangming) channels to promote circulation of qi and blood, and thus dispel obstruction and stop pain, for example in painful disorders such as painful obstruction. However the abundance of qi and blood in the arm and foot yangming channels means that their points are not only important to dispel stagnation, but also to tonify qi and blood in the channels and thus bring nourishment to the limbs in case of atrophy disorder and hemiplegia. In practice, Hégǔ LI-4 is commonly combined with [Jiānyú LI-15](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-15) and [Qūchí LI-11](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-11) in the 'chain and lock' point association method for pain, paralysis or atrophy of the upper limb.

Bilateral Hégǔ LI-4 and [Tàichōng LIV-3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LIV-3) are known as the Four Gates. This combination first appeared in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries which said "for cold and heat with painful obstruction, open the Four Gates". The text goes on to imply that the yuan-source points of the six yang channels emerge at the four gates. Since a fundamental principle for treating painful obstruction is to select points from yang channels, this helps to explain why these two points are considered so effective in treating painful obstruction. Subsequently, the use of the Four Gates has been extended to treat a variety of disorders involving pain and spasm. This is an elegant combination. Hégǔ LI-4 on the upper extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metacarpals, whilst [Tàichōng LIV-3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LIV-3) on the lower extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metatarsals. Hégǔ LI-4, the yuan-source point, belongs to yangming channel which is 'abundant in qi and blood' whilst [Tàichōng LIV-3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LIV-3), the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Liver channel, has the function of spreading the qi. Together they are able to activate the qi and blood and ensure their free and smooth passage throughout the body.

Hégǔ LI-4 has a strong action on promoting labour. The Ode to Elucidate Mysteries tells how the Song dynasty Crown Prince, in a dispute with the doctor Xu Wen-bai over whether a pregnant woman was carrying a girl or twins, ordered her belly to be cut open to find out. Xu Wen-bai begged to use his needles instead, and on reducing [Zúsānlǐ ST-36](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-36) and reinforcing Hégǔ LI-4 two babies emerged. Due to its strong action of inducing labour, and even promoting the expulsion of a dead foetus, Hégǔ LI-4 is contraindicated in pregnancy.

Finally Hégǔ LI-4 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang, for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

#### 阐释 (Commentary)

[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 被金代名医马丹阳列为“十一穴天星穴”之一，是他最重要的穴位组合。他指出此穴主治头痛、面部肿胀、疟疾伴恶寒发热、龋齿、鼻出血以及牙关紧闭不能言语。明代高武在其著作《针灸大成》中也认识到此穴的极端重要性，将其列为“四总穴”之一（面口合谷收）。几百年后，它仍然可能是最著名和最常用的穴位之一。

[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 是祛风散寒或风热、解表的主要穴位。从表里关系看，可以将阳明大肠经视为与阴经肺经相表里。肺主皮毛，宣发卫气，主宰肌表。因此，治疗侵袭肺系肌表部分的外感风寒或风热，可通过针刺大肠经的穴位，最重要的是[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md)。故《针灸大成》推荐此穴治疗“伤寒头痛，脊强，无汗”。这是风寒束表证的典型表现。中医学治疗此病的基本原则是发汗解表，通过汗液排出病邪，促进卫气运行。实际上，[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 也可用于治疗伴有汗出（此处指不能排出病邪的病理性汗出）的任何外邪侵袭。[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 既能发汗又能止汗的双重作用，在《针灸大成》中有所体现：无汗时，补[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md)，泻[KID7 复溜](/point/KID7.md)；多汗时，泻[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md)，补[KID7 复溜](/point/KID7.md)。这种看似矛盾的功能可以通过[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 能够调理卫气，从而调节汗孔开合来解释，无论何种病症皆可应用。事实上，一些医家甚至认为[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 具有益卫气的作用。

上述引自《针灸大成》的条文中包含“大渴”这一症状，这显然不是典型表证的表现（表证发热口渴相对较轻）。然而，这反映了[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md)，特别是与[LI11 曲池](/point/LI11.md) 联合使用时，能够退各种原因引起的高热。

[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 是治疗头面部和五官疾病最重要的穴位。众多经典都强调了这一点，例如《玉龙歌》中说：“头面耳目鼻口齿诸病皆治”。此穴是治疗影响这些区域的任何疾病的关键穴位——无论是急慢性、寒热、虚实——但在临床上最少用于治疗耳部疾病。就头痛而言，[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 适用于治疗任何位置因外邪侵袭引起的头痛，尤其适用于前额部（阳明经）头痛。然而，在临床实践中，它的应用范围更广，例如《玉龙歌》推荐[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 治疗偏头痛或全头痛，而《玉龙赋》更具体地推荐[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 治疗无痰头风，[GB20 风池](/point/GB20.md) 治疗有痰头风。[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 与前额和头侧的关联反映了大肠经内部循行与胆经在[GB14 阳白](/point/GB14.md)、[GB5 悬颅](/point/GB5.md) 和[GB6 悬厘](/point/GB6.md) 处交会的事实。

[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 被认为具有特殊的止痛能力，尤其是在上述区域，是针灸镇痛常用的穴位。中医学认为，实性疼痛是由于气血运行不畅导致瘀滞所致。正如俗话所说：“不通则痛，通则不痛”。[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 治疗疼痛的特殊能力可由《灵枢》中“阳明经多气多血”的论述来解释。这强调了大肠经和胃经（阳明经）的穴位具有促进气血运行的特殊能力，从而消散瘀滞，止痛，例如在痹证等疼痛性疾病中。然而，手足阳明经气血充盛意味着它们的穴位不仅对于消散瘀滞重要，也能够补益经络中的气血，从而在痿证和偏瘫时为肢体提供濡养。临床上，[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 常与[LI15 肩髃](/point/LI15.md) 和[LI11 曲池](/point/LI11.md) 联合使用，在“链锁法”中治疗上肢的疼痛、麻痹或萎缩。

双侧[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 和[LIV3 太冲](/point/LIV3.md) 被称为四关穴。此组合首次出现在《标幽赋》中，其中提到“寒热痛痹，开四关”。该文接着暗示六条阳经的原穴皆出于四关。由于治疗痹证的基本原则之一是选取阳经穴位，这有助于解释为何这两个穴位在治疗痹证方面如此有效。随后，四关穴的应用已扩展到治疗各种伴有疼痛和痉挛的疾病。这是一个精妙的组合。上肢的[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 位于第一和第二掌骨之间的宽阔凹陷处，而下肢的[LIV3 太冲](/point/LIV3.md) 位于第一和第二跖骨之间的宽阔凹陷处。原穴[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 属于“多气多血”的阳明经，而[LIV3 太冲](/point/LIV3.md) 作为肝经的输穴和原穴，具有疏调肝气的作用。它们联合使用能够激发气血，确保其在全身畅通无阻。

[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 具有很强的催产作用。《标幽赋》讲述了宋代太子与医生许文白关于一名孕妇怀的是女孩还是双胞胎发生争执，太子命令剖开孕妇腹部以查验。许文白请求用针代替，他泻[ST36 足三里](/point/ST36.md)，补[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 后，孕妇顺利产下两子。由于其具有很强的催产作用，甚至可以促进死胎排出，[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md) 在怀孕期间禁针。

最后，《回阳九针歌》中列举了[LI4 合谷](/point/LI4.md)，用于治疗亡阳证，表现为昏厥、恶寒、四肢厥逆、口唇青紫等。
