#### Commentary

In the Essential Questions [37](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-governing-vessel/references) the Yellow Emperor says "I have heard that wind is the beginning of the hundred diseases; what is the method of treating it by acupuncture"? His adviser Qi Bo replies "Wind enters from the exterior giving rise to shivering, sweating, headache, heaviness of the body and aversion to cold. Treat it by needling Fēngfǔ DU-16".

Wind, which may be of exterior or interior origin, is a yang pathogenic factor that therefore tends to affect the outer and upper (yang) portions of the body. Exterior wind predominantly injures the head and the superficial portion of the body, whilst interior wind stirs upwards and harasses the top of the body. The Governing vessel is known as the 'sea of the yang channels', and whilst many of its points are effective to eliminate both exterior and interior wind, Fēngfǔ DU-16 (Palace of Wind) is pre-eminent for this purpose. Its importance in the treatment of both kinds of wind disorder is emphasised in Investigation into Points Along the Channels by the Ming dynasty author Yan Zhen-shi, who said that Fēngfǔ DU-16 is indicated for "all types of wind disease".

When pathogenic wind invades the exterior portion of the body and impairs the ability of defensive qi to warm the skin, there will aversion to cold and shivering. If defensive qi is deficient and pathogenic wind attacks, the pattern known as disharmony of the nutritive qi and defensive qi may ensue, characterised by chills and shivering accompanied by sweating. The application of Fēngfǔ DU-16 in the treatment of this particular pattern of taiyang wind disorder is emphasised in the Treatise on Injury by Cold which says "In taiyang disorder, initially prescribe Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction). If this causes agitation, needle [Fēngchí GB-20](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-20) and Fēngfǔ DU-16 then (once again) represcribe Gui Zhi Tang. Recovery will follow". If pathogenic wind enters the channels and collaterals and penetrates the joints, there may be migratory aching and pain, known as 'wind painful obstruction'. In all such cases Fēngfǔ DU-16 is indicated.

Fēngfǔ DU-16 is of equal importance in the treatment of interior wind which derives from disharmony of the zangfu, particularly the Liver, and rushes upwards to the neck, head and brain. It is therefore indicated for headache, head wind, dizziness, blurred vision, upward staring eyes and windstroke. Not only is Fēngfǔ DU-16 able to descend pathogenic wind from the head in such cases, but it is also an important point to nourish the brain. According to the Spiritual Pivot [38](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-governing-vessel/references) Fēngfǔ DU-16 is a point of the sea of marrow, "Its point above is the top of the head; below it is Fengfu" and "When the sea of marrow is in excess then there is lightness of the body and much strength and a person's self exceeds the normal level; when the sea of marrow is insufficient there is a whirling sensation of the brain, dizziness, tinnitus, pain of the lower legs, impairment of vision, indolence and desire to sleep". The wide-ranging effect of Fēngfǔ DU-16 on the head region is further emphasised both by the statement by Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas that Fēngfǔ DU-16 treats 'the hundred diseases of the head', and by the alternative name Xingxing (Clear Headedness) given to this point in the classic Song to Keep Up Your Sleeve.

Due to the location of Fēngfǔ DU-16 in the neck region, the pivot of the head, as well as to its ability to eliminate wind and nourish the sea of marrow, Fēngfǔ DU-16 is an important point in the treatment of headache, head wind and neck disorders. The traditional term head wind has two principal meanings. Firstly it is used to refer to severe, long-standing and recurring headaches (for example migraine) that are recalcitrant to treatment, in contrast to a single incident of headache. Secondly, it describes a condition deriving from attack by exterior wind which invades the channels of the head and gives rise to headache, dizziness and deviation of the mouth and eye. Although primarily indicated for occipital (taiyang region) headache, as would be expected from its location, Fēngfǔ DU-16 is a meeting point of the Governing vessel with the Yang Linking vessel. This extraordinary vessel also links all the yang channels, and specifically connects with such important points for headache as [Běnshén GB-13](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-13) through to [Fēngchí GB-20](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/GB-20) on the lateral side of the head, and [Tóuwéi ST-8](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-8) on the forehead. Fēngfǔ DU-16 may therefore be needled in shaoyang (temporal) or yangming (frontal) region headaches when the primary pathogen is wind. As far as the neck is concerned, the ability of Fēngfǔ DU-16 to benefit this region is emphasised in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion which recounts how the great 2nd century physician Hua Tuo treated the Emperor Wu of the Three Kingdoms era for stiff neck. It is related that as soon as Hua Tuo needled Fēngfǔ DU-16, the Emperor was cured.

It is a reflection of yin-yang theory that when excess accumulates at the top of the body there is often a corresponding deficiency below, and this is borne out in the statement in the classic Song to Keep Up Your Sleeve "when the legs and feet are diseased choose Fēngfǔ DU-16". The ability of Fēngfǔ DU-16 to treat numbness of the legs reflects the principle stated in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic [39](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-governing-vessel/references) "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

Although the Heart is most frequently cited as the residence of the spirit, since its early beginnings Chinese medicine (particularly in the Daoist tradition) has been able to hold the concurrent belief that the head and brain also influence the spirit. Thus the Essential Questions [40](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-governing-vessel/references) said "the head is the residence of the intelligence", Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas said "The head is the supreme leader, the place where man's spirit concentrates" and Li Shi-zhen said "The brain is the residence of the original spirit". The Governing vessel enters the brain at Fēngfǔ DU-16, which is also said to mark its lower border, whilst another branch of the vessel passes through the Heart. Fēngfǔ DU-16 is therefore indicated for various mental disorders such as mania, incessant talking with inability to rest, mad walking and desire to commit suicide, as well as sadness and fear with fright palpitations. It was included under its alternative name of Guizhen (Ghost Pillow) by Sun Si-miao in his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy.

Finally, Fēngfǔ DU-16 is one of ten points listed in Chapter 2 of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as [Window of Heaven](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/about-point-categories/points-of-the-window-of-heaven "Window of Heaven") points. It shares with the other points of this group the ability to i. treat headache and dizziness, ii. descend rebellious qi (vomiting), iii. treat throat disorders, iv. benefit the sense organs (eyes, nose and tongue), and v. treat sudden onset of disorders (sudden inability to speak following windstroke, sudden loss of voice).

#### 1.7. 论述

《素问》中黄帝问：“闻风为百病之始，针治何法？”岐伯答：“风自外入致振栗、出汗、头痛、身重恶寒，针[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)治之。”  

风为阳邪，外风主伤头及表部，内风上扰头部。督脉为“阳脉之海”，多穴能祛内外风，[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)（风之府）尤为卓越。《经穴探》明代严真氏称其治“诸风病”。  

外风侵表，卫气不温肌肤则恶寒振栗；卫虚受风，营卫不和则寒颤出汗。《伤寒论》指太阴病初服桂枝汤烦躁，针[GB20 风池](/point/GB20.md)与[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)，复服桂枝汤即愈。若风入经络关节，则游走疼痛，称“风痹”，[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)皆适用。  

[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)治内风，由脏腑失调（尤肝）上冲颈头脑，故用于头痛、头风、眩晕、视蒙、目上视、中风。其不仅降头风，亦养脑。《灵枢》称[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)为髓海穴，“上在巅顶，下在风府”，“髓海有余则身轻力多，人自超常；不足则脑转眩晕、耳鸣、腿痛、视障、怠欲眠。”孙思邈《千金方》谓其治“头百病”，《袖珍歌》别名“醒醒”（清醒），强调其广治头部疾患。  

因位于颈部（头之枢纽），兼祛风养髓海，[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)治头痛、头风、颈病。“头风”有二义：1. 重、久、复发头痛（如偏头痛），难治；2. 外风侵头经络，致头痛、眩晕、口眼歪斜。虽主治太阴区（枕部）头痛，因其与阳维脉交会，联诸阳经及[GB13 本神](/point/GB13.md)至[GB20 风池](/point/GB20.md)（侧头）、[ST8 头维](/point/ST8.md)（前额），故风为主邪时亦治少阳（颞）、阳明（额）头痛。颈部方面，《针灸大成》述华佗针[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)治三国吴帝颈僵，针入即愈。  

阴阳理论谓上盛常下虚，《袖珍歌》称“足腿病选[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)”，其治腿麻反映《内经》“病在下取上”原则。  

虽心常为神居，中医（尤道家）早信头脑亦影响神。《素问》谓“头为精明之府”，孙思邈称“头为至尊，人神聚处”，李时珍谓“脑为元神之府”。督脉于[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)入脑（为其下界），另支经心，故[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)治躁狂、多言不休、狂走欲自杀、悲恐惊悸等精神疾患。孙思邈以别名“鬼枕”列入“十三鬼穴”，治躁病及癫痫。  

[DU16 风府](/point/DU16.md)为《灵枢》第二章十天窗穴之一，与此类穴共能：1. 治头痛眩晕，2. 降逆气（呕吐），3. 治喉病，4. 益感官（眼、鼻、舌），5. 治突发病（如中风后突发不能言、突发失音）。  

#### 1.8. 临床应用总结
