#### Commentary

Chǐzé LU-5 is the water and he-sea point of the Lung channel. Its principal action is to clear all forms of heat (whether excess or deficient) from the Lung, and to descend Lung qi.

Excess heat in the Lung may be due to interior or exterior factors. Interior factors include smoking, over-consumption of rich, greasy, spicy food and alcohol, transformation of long-standing retention of phlegm-damp into phlegm-heat, and invasion by Liver fire. Exterior factors include pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat which penetrate the Lung zang and transform into heat. Deficiency heat in the Lung may be due either to depletion and exhaustion of Lung and Kidney yin, or to damage to Lung yin by long-standing or repeated attacks of excess heat. The presence of any form of heat in the Lung will disturb its function of descending qi and lead to such symptoms of rebellion of Lung qi as coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing and asthma. In the case of excess heat there may be coughing of phlegm and agitation and fullness of the chest, whilst in cases of deficiency heat there may be tidal fever or taxation fever and dry mouth and tongue.

Whilst equally applicable to cases of both excess and deficiency heat, the appropriate combination of Chǐzé LU-5 with other points will determine the different approach required in the treatment of these two conditions. In the case of excess heat, characterised by fullness in the chest and expectoration of yellow, green or brown phlegm, it may be combined with points to transform phlegm and clear heat such as [Fēnglóng ST-40](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-40) and [Zhōngfǔ LU-1](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LU-1). In the case of deficiency heat, characterised by dry mouth and tongue and tidal fever or taxation fever, it may be combined with points to nourish yin and moisten the Lung such as [Tàiyuān LU-9](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LU-9), [Gāohuāngshū BL-43](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-43) and [Tàixī KID-3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/KID-3).

According to the Classic of Difficulties[](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-lung-channel/references)[12](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-lung-channel/references) he-sea points are indicated for "counterflow qi and diarrhoea", whilst the Spiritual Pivot says "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point"[](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-lung-channel/references)[13](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-lung-channel/references). The Lung and Stomach both dominate descending whilst the Lung channel arises in the middle jiao, in the region of the Stomach. In addition to descending rebellious Lung qi, Chǐzé LU-5 also treats vomiting due to rebellious Stomach qi, as well as diarrhoea and abdominal distention.

The Discourse Into the Origins and Development of Medicine says "The Lung is the delicate zang, neither heat nor cold is appropriate ... too hot and the fire will melt the metal and the blood will stir". Heat in the Lung, whether of deficient or excess type, may injure the blood vessels and give rise to reckless bleeding, characterised by coughing or spitting of blood or nosebleed. As well as being indicated for heat-induced bleeding from the Lung, due to its secondary action of descending Stomach qi Chǐzé LU-5 may also be used for vomiting blood. The Song of Points for Miscellaneous Diseases states uncompromisingly "In cases of vomiting blood the action of Chǐzé LU-5 is without comparison"[](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-lung-channel/references)[14](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-lung-channel/references).

The close relationship of the Lung to body fluids is emphasised in two sayings of Chinese medicine "The Lung is the upper source of water" and "The Lung dominates the movement of water". If exterior pathogenic wind obstructs the Lung's function of regulating the water passages and descending body fluid, there may be urinary retention as well as swelling of the four limbs. If the Lung is deficient, there may be enuresis or frequent urination. Chǐzé LU-5 is indicated in both these patterns.

The Lung and Heart dominate the upper jiao and share an intimate relationship. The Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Disease says "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected; when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". When Lung heat transmits to the Heart there will be agitation, whilst if heat condenses the blood and gives rise to blood stasis, there will be Heart pain. In both these situations Chǐzé LU-5 is indicated.

Occupying a central position along the Lung channel, Chǐzé LU-5 has an important effect on the whole upper limb, and is indicated for disorders of the channel in the shoulder, upper arm, elbow and hand characterised by pain and restricted motion. Migratory pain due to attack of pathogenic wind-damp is known as wandering painful obstruction or wind painful obstruction, and as well as being indicated for wandering painful obstruction of the upper arm and elbow, Chǐzé LU-5 appears in classical combinations for wind painful obstruction of the whole body. Many classical sources particularly mention the ability of Chǐzé LU-5 to relax contraction of the sinews, for example the Song of the Jade Dragon says "In contraction of the sinews with difficulty in opening and extending the hand, the use of Chǐzé LU-5 should always be emphasised". Its use in the treatment of pain and contraction of the elbow is self-evident, and it is especially useful in the treatment of tennis elbow in preference to [Qūchí LI-11](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-11), as a needle inserted at Chǐzé LU-5 can be more easily directed towards the area of acute focalised tenderness. Chǐzé LU-5 is also indicated for swelling and pain of the knee (crane's knee wind) reflecting the commonly used 'cross-connection' method of needling the equivalently positioned joint in the upper limb to treat disorders of the lower limb and vice-versa.

Interestingly, Chǐzé LU-5 also treats 'the five types of lumbar pain'. In a sense this point, located in the flexure of the elbow joint, can be viewed as the equivalent on the upper limb of [Wěizhōng BL-40](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/BL-40) which is located in the flexure of the knee joint and is much used for lumbar pain.

#### Summary of clinical application

- For heat-induced bleeding from the Lung or Stomach: vomiting or coughing of blood, nosebleed.
- Regulates urination: swelling of the four limbs, enuresis, frequent urination.

#### 1.7. 论述

[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)为肺经水穴、合穴，主清肺热（实热或虚热），降肺气。  

肺实热由内外因引起。内因包括吸烟、过食肥甘辛辣酒、痰湿久蕴化痰热、肝火侵肺；外因包括风寒或风热侵肺脏化热。虚热由肺肾阴竭或反复实热伤肺阴引起。任何肺热扰降气功能，致咳嗽、气短、喘鸣、哮喘。实热可咳痰、胸烦满，虚热可潮热、劳热、口舌干。  

[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)适用于实虚热，需配穴区分。实热（胸满、咳黄绿褐痰）配化痰清热穴如[ST40 丰隆](/point/ST40.md)、[LU1 中府](/point/LU1.md)；虚热（口舌干、潮热、劳热）配滋阴润肺穴如[LU9 太渊](/point/LU9.md)、[BL43 膏肓俞](/point/BL43.md)、[KID3 太溪](/point/KID3.md)。  

《难经》称合穴治“逆气泻”，《灵枢》谓“胃病及饮食不节之病，取合穴”。肺胃皆主降，肺经起于中焦胃区，除降肺逆气，[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)治胃气上逆之呕吐及泻、腹胀。  

《医源论》谓：“肺为娇脏，寒热不宜……过热火熔金，血动。”肺热（虚实）伤血脉，致咳吐血、鼻衄。[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)治肺热出血及胃热呕血。《杂病穴歌》称：“呕血[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)效无伦。”  

中医谓“肺为水之上源”“肺主行水”。外风阻肺调水降液致尿闭、四肢肿；肺虚致遗尿、尿频。[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)皆适用。  

肺心主上焦，关系密切。《温病经纬》谓：“肺心相连，肺热易入心。”肺热传心致烦，热凝血瘀致心痛，[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)皆治。  

[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)居肺经中部，作用于上肢，治肩、上臂、肘、手经络病变之痛及动限。风湿侵致游走痛称游走痹或风痹，[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)治上臂肘风痹及全身风痹。经典多指其舒筋，如《玉龙颂》谓：“筋挛手难伸展，[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)宜重。”治肘痛收缩尤效，优于[LI11 曲池](/point/LI11.md)治网球肘，因针[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)易刺向急性局限痛点。[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)亦治膝肿痛（鹤膝风），反映上下肢对应穴治法。  

[LU5 尺泽](/point/LU5.md)治“五种腰痛”，其位于肘关节屈侧，类同膝关节屈侧的[BL40 委中](/point/BL40.md)，后者常用于腰痛。
