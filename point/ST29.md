#### Commentary

The name of this point 'Guilai' (Return) is normally understood to refer to its ability to restore the condition of the uterus and genitals to normal.

According to the Essential Questions[15](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) "qi and blood desire warmth and dislike cold; when [there is] cold they coagulate; when [there is] warmth they disperse and flow". The Spiritual Pivot[16](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-stomach-channel/references) states "The blood [vessels], nutritive and defensive [qi] of man circulate without stopping, in the same way that the stars do in the upper region and the rivers in the lower region. When a cold pathogen comes to reside in the channels as a guest, the blood will coagulate; when the blood coagulates the channels do not move".

The over-riding action of Guīlái ST-29 is to warm the lower jiao, most particularly the uterus in women and the genital region in both men and women. Cold may be excess or deficient in nature. As far as excess cold is concerned, the uterus (along with the Stomach, Spleen and intestines) belongs to that group of the zangfu or extra fu that can suffer from direct penetration by exterior pathogenic cold (i.e. without initial symptoms and signs of an exterior pattern such as chills and fever, body aches etc.). Injury of the uterus by cold may be due to inadequate clothing or sitting on cold ground, or over-consumption of cold foods and drinks, especially during menstruation or after childbirth. Pathogenic cold causes stagnation of qi and coagulation of blood in the uterus and disrupts the function of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, giving rise to disorders such as amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, uterine masses etc. Guīlái ST-29 is one of the primary points to warm the uterus and drive out pathogenic cold.

As far as deficiency cold is concerned, Guīlái ST-29 is also an important point for treating disorders due to decline of Kidney yang which generates cold, giving rise to irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, infertility etc. The ability of Guīlái ST-29 to treat such disorders derives from its action of warming and benefiting the uterus rather than by directly tonifying Kidney yang. Guīlái ST-29 is also indicated for running piglet qi which may arise when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao (see [Qìchōng ST-30](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-30)).

Amenorrhoea may be due to either excess or deficient patterns (stagnation of qi and stasis of blood, pathogenic cold, phlegm stagnation, blood deficiency, Kidney deficiency or heat pathogen which consumes yin blood). Due to its action of 'returning' the menstruation,Guīlái ST-29 is commonly used in the treatment of amenorrhoea due to any of these patterns.

The genital region in both men and women is equally susceptible to attack by pathogenic cold, giving rise to a variety of symptoms characterised by pain and retraction of the testicles, penis or vagina. As well as being able to warm and scatter excess cold in this region, Guīlái ST-29can firm and warm the lower jiao and is used in the treatment of disorders such as impotence, seminal emission, leucorrhoea and nocturnal urination due to decline of ming men fire.

Although the clinical manifestations will be somewhat different in each of the above situations, most will be characterised by aversion to cold and preference for and amelioration with heat. Since Guīlái ST-29 is mainly indicated for cold patterns it is particularly suited to treatment by combined needling and moxibustion.

#### Summary of clinical application

- Warms and regulates the uterus and menstruation: amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, uterine masses due to cold, uterine prolapse, coldness and pain and swelling of the vagina, infertility, leucorrhoea.
- Warms and benefits the genitals: retraction of the testicles, impotence, pain of the penis, seminal emission, shan disorder.

#### 阐释 (Commentary)

此穴名称“归来”通常被理解为指其能够使子宫和生殖器恢复正常状态。

根据《素问·阴阳应象大论》记载：“血气者，喜温而恶寒，寒则凝，温则散。”《灵枢·刺节真邪》记载：“人身之血，荣卫之气，昼夜不休，如天之星辰，地之河流。客邪居于经络，血凝，血凝则经不通。”

[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 的主要作用是温煦下焦，尤其是在女性的子宫和男女的生殖器区域。寒邪可分为实证或虚证。就实寒而言，子宫（与胃、脾和肠道一起）属于脏腑或奇恒之腑中可受外来寒邪直接侵袭的范畴（即没有表证的初步症状和体征，如恶寒发热、身体疼痛等）。子宫受寒可能由于衣着不足或坐于寒凉之地，或过量食用寒凉食物和饮料，尤其是在月经期或产后。寒邪导致子宫气滞血凝，扰乱任脉和冲脉的功能，引起闭经、月经不调、子宫癥瘕积聚等疾病。[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 是温煦子宫、祛除寒邪的主要穴位之一。

就虚寒而言，[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 也是治疗肾阳衰退生寒所致疾病的重要穴位，引起月经不调、闭经、不孕症等。[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 治疗此类疾病的能力源于其温煦子宫、益生殖器的作用，而非直接补益肾阳。[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 也主治奔豚气，这可能发生在肾阳不足导致寒邪积聚下焦时（参见[ST30 气冲](point/ST30.md)）。

闭经可能由实证或虚证引起（气滞血瘀、寒邪、痰滞、血虚、肾虚或耗伤阴血的热邪）。由于其“归来”月经的作用，[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 常用于治疗各种证型引起的闭经。

无论男性还是女性的生殖器区域，都同样易受寒邪侵袭，引起多种以疼痛和睾丸、阴茎或阴道缩引为特征的症状。[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 除了能温散此区域的实寒外，还能固摄和温煦下焦，用于治疗因命门火衰引起的阳痿、遗精、带下和夜尿等疾病。

尽管上述每种情况下的临床表现会有所不同，但大多数都以恶寒、喜温和受热后症状缓解为特征。由于[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 主要主治寒证，因此特别适合针灸并用治疗。

#### 临床应用总结 (Summary of clinical application)

* 温煦调理子宫和月经：闭经，月经不调，寒凝子宫癥瘕积聚，子宫脱垂，阴道寒冷、疼痛和肿胀，不孕症，带下。
* 温煦益生殖器：睾丸缩引，阳痿，阴茎疼痛，遗精，疝气。

#### 穴位组合 (Combinations)

* 睾丸下坠肿胀无痛：[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md)，[LIV1 大敦](point/LIV1.md) 和[SP6 三阴交](point/SP6.md)（《针灸大成》）。
* 睾丸缩引：[ST29 归来](point/ST29.md) 和[GB27 五枢](point/GB27.md)（《资生经》）。
