#### Commentary

The Liver, entrusted with the ministerial fire, is known as the ‘indomitable zang’ and corresponds to the energies of Spring, growth and forcefulness. Although the Liver free-flowing function assists the ascent and descent of the qi of all the zangfu, its own qi direction is upwards, hence the saying “The Liver governs uprising”. Since its yang activity is by nature exuberant, fierce and strong, the Liver easily becomes overheated and the normal ascending of Liver qi readily flares up into excess. _The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion_ says “When the Liver is excess, reduce Xingjian LIV-2” whilst according to the _Classic of Difficulties_[2](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references) ying-spring points are indicated for ‘heat in the body’. Xingjian LIV-2, the ying-spring and fire point of the Liver channel, is therefore the principal point on this channel, indeed in the whole body, to clear Liver fire and descend Liver yang. It has three principal spheres of activity: the head, the emotions and the lower jiao.

The Liver primary channel ascends along the neck and posterior aspect of the throat to the nasopharynx and the tissues surrounding the eye, and then ascends across the forehead to link with [Baihui DU-20](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/DU-20) at the vertex. Xingjian LIV-2 consequently is much used clinically to treat headache, dizziness, burning heat of the face, nosebleed, throat painful obstruction and dry throat, red and painful eyes, lacrimation and other eye diseases due to Liver fire ascending to the head, although it is interesting to note that headache, dizziness and nosebleed are modern indications and do not appear in any of the major classical acupuncture texts. When extreme, Liver fire or Liver yang may give rise to stirring of interior wind, and Xingjian LIV-2 is used to treat such consequences of this development as epilepsy, loss of consciousness, childhood fright wind, contracted sinews, windstroke and deviation of the mouth.

_The Spiritual Pivot_[3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references) says “The Liver stores blood and the blood is the residence of the ethereal soul [hun]; when Liver qi is deficient there is fear, when excess there is anger”, whilst the _Essential Questions_[4](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references) says “Anger easily injures the Liver”. The free and unobstructed spreading of the Liver qi is closely related to the harmonious interplay of the seven emotions. Repression of any of the emotions will cause the Liver qi to stagnate, and after time to transform into fire. At the same time, stagnation of Liver qi, and even more so the blazing up of Liver fire, will render a person prone to experience feelings of irritability and anger. At the stage of qi stagnation, acknowledgement and expression of the appropriate emotion will help free the qi and dispel stagnation, thus Fei Bo-xiong said “Joy, anger, melancholy, anxiety, grief, fear and terror are common to everyone. Giving vent to joy, anger and melancholy as occasion requires is what is meant by venting emotions properly”[5](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references). When Liver fire is blazing, however, it is like a fire with an unlimited supply of fuel, and giving vent to rage and anger will not only fail to dispel the fire but will continually stoke and encourage it. At the same time, the anger itself will injure the body, and at this stage moderation of excessive emotion and not spontaneous expression must be practised. Thus Cao Tong of the Qing dynasty recommended in Common Sayings on Gerontology “When faced with something exasperating, one should calmly consider which is more important, anger or health. This comparison will enable one to gradually eliminate one’s anger”[6](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references). Li Yi-ru of the Qing dynasty, however, said “Of the seven emotions, anger is the hardest to control”. Acupuncture treatment seeks to quell and douse the fire, and Xingjian LIV-2 is the primary point to subdue blazing Liver fire giving rise to such manifestations as raging anger with a red face and clutching sensation in the throat. _The Spiritual Pivot_[7](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references) says “with anger the qi rebels upwards and accumulates in the chest”. If Liver fire and stagnant qi attack the chest and Lung they will give rise to distention and pain, shortness of breath, sighing and difficulty in catching the breath. If, as is commonly seen clinically, Liver fire and stagnant qi transmit to the Heart there will be pain of both the Liver and Heart, as well as severe disturbance of the spirit manifesting as mania disorder, insomnia, palpitations etc. If there is a deeply established pattern of repression of anger, usually deriving from early childhood experiences, then the stagnant qi and fire will have no appropriate outlet and a person may become sad and tearful. Anger, overt or hidden, is not the only emotion associated with the Liver however, as stressed by the statement in the Spiritual Pivot that “when Liver qi is deficient there is fear”. The Liver and Gall Bladder are associated in Chinese culture with decisiveness and courage. If the Liver is deficient, especially Liver blood, or if a person is unable to acknowledge their anger and thus embrace their power and courage, there may be fear and fright with a feeling of lack of strength and a tendency to close the eyes and have “no desire to look”.

The Liver stores the blood, and the Liver channel converges with the Conception vessel in the lower abdomen at [Qugu REN-2](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-2), [Zhongji REN-3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-3) and [Guanyuan REN-4](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/REN-4). Liver fire can easily transmit to the uterine blood and induce wild and reckless flow, manifesting as ceaseless uterine bleeding, menorrhagia and early menstruation. If heat condenses the blood and causes stagnation, or if Liver qi stagnation is prolonged, uterine (jia) masses may form or there may be inhibited menstruation. Disturbance of the blood by Liver fire may also give rise to coughing of blood and nosebleed. 

The Liver channel encircles the genitals and penetrates the lower abdomen, whilst the Liver assists the free movement of qi throughout the body. If there is qi stagnation or consequent fire or damp-heat in the lower jiao, especially the genital region or Bladder, there may be a variety of symptoms such as itching and pain of the genitals, sudden involuntary erection, painful urinary dysfunction, retention of urine, difficult and turbid urination, leucorrhoea and shan disorder. If qi stagnation binds the intestines there may be constipation. In all these cases Xingjian LIV-2 may be used.

One special condition for which Xingjian LIV-2 is indicated is the symptom of hands and feet counterflow cold, where only the hands and feet are cold but the body is warm. This may occur in the pattern known as ‘true heat, false cold’, where heat constrained in the interior prevents the yang qi from circulating to the limbs. Despite the apparent cold, the other symptoms, as well as the pulse and the tongue, are indicative of heat and constraint. In clinical practice, this symptom is often encountered in patients with Liver qi stagnation rather than heat, where the stagnant qi prevents adequate circulation of qi to the extremities.

According to the _Spiritual Pivot_[8](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-liver-channel/references) “The Liver governs the sinews”, and Xingjian LIV-2 is indicated in many classical sources for pain of the lumbar region. Although more commonly ascribed to Kidney deficiency or painful obstruction, stagnation of Liver qi or Liver blood deficiency may also give rise to lumbar pain due to contraction and inflexibility of the sinews. However the frequency with which Xingjian LIV-2 appears in classical combinations for lumbar pain, points more towards an empirical application rather than a theoretical one.

Finally, Xingjian LIV-2 is indicated for swelling of the knee, pain of the inner aspect of the leg, heat in the shins and pain and swelling of the instep, and the _Song of Points for Miscellaneous Diseases_ says “for leg and knee pain covet Xingjian LIV-2”.

#### 1.6. 论述

肝受托于相火，被称为“刚脏”，对应春季的生长与力量。尽管肝的疏泄功能助所有脏腑气升降，其自身气向为上行，故有“肝主升发”之说。因其阳性活动本性旺盛、激烈，肝易过热，正常上升的肝气易亢盛。《针灸大成》称：“肝实泻[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)”，《难经》谓荥穴主“身热”。[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)作为肝经荥穴和火穴，是此经乃至全身清肝火、降肝阳的主穴，其作用有三：头部、情绪及下焦。  

肝经原经沿颈及咽后上行至鼻咽及眼周组织，再上行过额部与[DU20 百会](point/DU20.md)相连。因此，[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)常用于临床治疗肝火上行至头部的头痛、眩晕、面部灼热、鼻衄、咽痹、咽干、目赤痛、流泪及其他眼疾，但值得注意的是，头痛、眩晕及鼻衄是现代适应症，未见于主要经典针灸文献。当肝火或肝阳极盛，可引起内风，[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)用于治疗癫痫、昏迷、小儿惊风、筋挛、中风及口歪等后果。  

《灵枢》称：“肝藏血，血为魂之居；肝气虚则恐，实则怒。”《素问》谓：“怒易伤肝。”肝气的顺畅疏泄与七情和谐密切相关。任何情绪压抑会导致肝气郁滞，久则化火。同时，肝气郁滞，尤其是肝火炽盛，会使人易怒。气滞阶段，适当表达情绪可疏气解郁，故费伯雄曰：“喜怒忧思悲恐惊，人皆有之，因时宣泄喜怒忧，方为得宜。”但肝火炽盛时，如火有无限燃料，宣泄怒气不仅无法熄火，反会助长之，且怒气伤身，此时须节制而非自然宣泄。清代曹彤在《老老恒言》中建议：“遇可怒之事，静心衡量怒与健康孰重，轻重比较，怒自渐消。”清代李贻儒却称：“七情中，怒最难抑。”针灸治疗旨在平息肝火，[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)是抑制肝火炽盛（如怒气冲天、面色发红、喉中紧缩）的主穴。《灵枢》称：“怒则气逆上聚于胸。”若肝火及气滞攻胸肺，会引起胀痛、短气、叹息及呼吸困难。若肝火及气滞传至心（如临床常见），则心肝俱痛，神志严重扰乱，表现为躁狂、失眠、心悸等。若怒气长期压抑（常源于童年经历），郁气及火无适当出口，人可能悲伤流泪。然而，肝相关情绪不仅是怒，《灵枢》强调“肝气虚则恐”。在中国文化中，肝胆与决断及勇气相关。若肝虚（尤其是肝血），或人无法正视怒气以拥抱力量与勇气，可能恐惧无力，闭目不愿视。  

肝藏血，肝经在下腹与任脉交会于[REN2 曲骨](point/REN2.md)、[REN3 中极](point/REN3.md)、[REN4 关元](point/REN4.md)。肝火易传至子宫血，引起狂乱流动，表现为子宫出血不止、经血过多及月经提前。若热凝血瘀，或肝气郁滞持久，可形成腹中瘕块或月经受阻。肝火扰血还可能引起咳血及鼻衄。  

肝经环绕生殖器并入下腹，肝助全身气顺畅。若下焦（尤其是生殖器或膀胱）气滞、火或湿热，可出现生殖器痛痒、突发勃起、尿痛、尿潴留、尿难、白浊、带下及疝病等症状。若气滞束缚肠道，可致便秘。[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)均适用。  

[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)指用于的特殊症状是四肢厥冷，即手足冷而身热。此见于“真热假寒”模式，内热郁阻阳气不达四肢。尽管表现为寒，手足厥冷伴其他热郁症状及脉舌表现。临床中，此症常因肝气郁滞而非热，郁气阻滞四末气血流通。  

《灵枢》称：“肝主筋。”[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)在多部经典中指用于腰痛。虽腰痛多归于肾虚或痛痹，肝气郁滞或肝血虚也可因筋挛缩及僵硬引起腰痛。然而，[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)在经典配伍中频现于腰痛治疗，更倾向于经验应用而非理论推导。  

最后，[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)适用于膝肿、腿内侧痛、胫热及足背肿痛，《杂病穴歌》称：“腿膝痛贪[LIV2 行间](point/LIV2.md)。”
